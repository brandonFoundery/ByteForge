## Next Steps for Dependent Agents

The following agents can now proceed:

1. **Frontend Agent Phase 2** - Can implement UI for:
   - Carrier portal for viewing and accepting load assignments
   - Invoice management and status tracking
   - Load assignment workflow management

2. **Integration Agent Phase 2** - Can implement:
   - External payment gateway integration for invoice payments
   - Email notifications for invoice generation and overdue statuses
   - Load assignment notifications to carriers

3. **Infrastructure Agent Phase 2** - Can implement:
   - Database migration for new tables (LoadAssignments, InvoiceLineItems)
   - Scheduled jobs for automatic invoice generation and overdue processing
   - Performance monitoring for the new endpoints
