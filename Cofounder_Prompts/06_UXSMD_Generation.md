Ask yourself:

I.
* Am I covering shared global UI views in my analysis (i.e. top navigation, footers, ...) in a separate section, which also details the components that share them?
* Am I assigning unique and expressive title-cased ids to them (in format "GV_{...}" i.e. "GV_TopNav")?
* Am I careful to consider cases of authenticated/unauthenticated (whether conditionals regarding accessing the view itself or conditionals on its contained elements) to make sure my coverage is not missing things?

* Am I covering all the needed unique UI views; for all the required features?
* Am I assigning unique and expressive title-cased ids to them (in format "UV_{...}" i.e. "UV_Landing")?
* Am I making sure unique views do not include duplicate shared global UI views which were already previously covered?
* Am I careful to consider cases of authenticated/unauthenticated (whether conditionals regarding accessing the view itself or conditionals on its contained elements) to make sure my coverage is not missing things?

* Am I extensively describing everything in details for the dev team to have 100% coverage of everything needed through my UX Sitemap Document analysis?

* Am I covering EVERYTHING expected to be present in this web app:
  - Every view (every unique view and every shared global view) expected to be in the app?
  - Every view's components expected to be in the app to cover all 100% of features and all their details?
  - Am I covering the views for all workflows, end to end?

* Am I making sure I am covering the core and essential features/views, and not some optional secondary/tertiary not really required stuff?

II.
* Am I describing the functional and features analysis of each view before further detailing it in order to have a cohesive and comprehensive analysis and not omit any details?
* What are all the requirements needed by features expected to be seen by users in terms of UI views (unique views and shared global views) and contained views' components?
* Cross analysis between feature <> ui views required to create in ux sitemap?
* What are ALL THE VIEWS required by ALL THE REQUIREMENTS required by the user?
* Am I covering all views (unique views and shared global views)? With all extensive details and descriptions?
* Am I making sure I am covering the core and essential features/views, and not some optional secondary/tertiary not really required stuff?

III.
Can I make a table for all the cross links analysis between different views in order to establish inter-app navigation relationships?
* Can I describe their intent in each case?
* Can I also describe how the linking works (in terms of ui elements/user interaction/action taken to trigger the link and where in the view)?

Source view | Target View | Intent | Action Description

* Am I covering 100% of relations links of what's needed for all in-app navigation, both static and dynamic?
* Am I truly covering all inter-app cross links relations and not missing anything?

> Analyze the task thoroughly, then reply with your analysis in markdown format
> Try to outdo yourself by thinking of what might be omitted, and reviewing your own work super critically in order to do comprehensive analytical work for this app's MVP
> Your job is to make thorough analysis work which will be provided as documentation for devteams to implement

---

> Stick to the provided formats and specifications:
- UI unique views with ids UV_*
- UI global shared views with ids GV_*

Do not make up new denominations or types, stick to the task exactly as specified!

---

Important:

> Do not make any "Container" views (like some GV_GlobalContainer or something); DO NOT make any container views to contain other views inside of them!
Only make unique UV_* or GV_* shared views: views that serve a functional purpose; not container views!

> GV_* shared views are INDEPENDENT from UV_*!
- UV_* views DO NOT INTEGRATE GV_* views inside them!
- They simply share screen space!!
- Do not make any UV_* functionality dependent on GV_*
- Do not make any GV_* functionality dependent on GV_*
- They are independent, they do not include each other, shared simply means sharing screen space, not functionalities!
