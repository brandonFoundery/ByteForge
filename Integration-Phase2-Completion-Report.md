## Known Issues

1. **Development Environment Limitations**: 
   - Some integration tests require actual Azure services for full functionality
   - Local development uses Azurite storage emulator

2. **Configuration Dependencies**:
   - Production deployment requires valid Azure service connection strings
   - Email service requires valid SendGrid API key for production use

3. **Package Dependencies**:
   - Requires NuGet packages: SendGrid, Azure.Storage.Blobs, Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus, Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore
   - May need package installation during build process

## Next Steps for Dependent Agents

The following integration services are now available for use by other agents:

1. **Frontend Agent**: Can implement file upload/download UI components using the document storage APIs
2. **Backend Agent**: Can use email service for notifications and event bus for domain event publishing
3. **Security Agent**: Can leverage telemetry service for security event tracking and audit trails
4. **Infrastructure Agent**: Can configure Azure services and monitor integration health
