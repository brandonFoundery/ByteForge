# End-to-End Workflows: Enterprise Business Process Integration

## Executive Summary
This document maps the complete end-to-end business workflows across the four enterprise systems, showing how customer requests flow through the entire logistics and payment ecosystem from initial load booking to final carrier payment.

## Primary Business Workflows

### 1. Complete Load-to-Payment Workflow

#### Overview
The primary business workflow encompasses the entire customer journey from load booking request to payment completion and carrier compensation.

#### Detailed Process Steps

##### Phase 1: Load Booking (Load Booking System)
1. **Customer Load Request**
   - Customer submits load details (origin, destination, cargo)
   - System validates addresses and cargo specifications
   - Load record created with unique identifier

2. **Carrier Assignment**
   - System searches available carriers by criteria
   - Rate negotiation and carrier selection
   - Load assignment confirmation

3. **Dispatch Confirmation**
   - Carrier accepts load assignment
   - Pickup and delivery schedules confirmed
   - Load status updated to "ASSIGNED"

##### Phase 2: Invoice Generation (Invoice Processing System)
1. **Automatic Invoice Creation**
   - Triggered by load assignment confirmation
   - Invoice generated based on agreed rates
   - Line items calculated (base rate, fuel surcharge, etc.)

2. **Invoice Approval Workflow**
   - Internal approval process if required
   - Rate validation and authorization
   - Invoice marked as "APPROVED"

3. **Customer Invoice Delivery**
   - Invoice sent via email or portal
   - Payment terms and due date specified
   - Invoice status updated to "SENT"

##### Phase 3: Load Execution (Load Booking System)
1. **Load Pickup**
   - Carrier arrives at pickup location
   - Cargo verification and documentation
   - Load status updated to "PICKED_UP"

2. **Transportation Tracking**
   - Real-time location updates
   - Status updates throughout transit
   - ETA updates and notifications

3. **Delivery Completion**
   - Cargo delivered to destination
   - Delivery confirmation and documentation
   - Load status updated to "DELIVERED"

##### Phase 4: Payment Processing (Customer Payment System)
1. **Customer Payment Submission**
   - Customer initiates payment via portal or system
   - Payment method validation and processing
   - Payment confirmation generated

2. **Payment Verification**
   - Transaction validation and fraud checking
   - Payment amount reconciliation with invoice
   - Payment status updated to "COMPLETED"

3. **Cross-System Notification**
   - Invoice system notified of payment
   - Load booking system updated
   - Carrier payment system triggered

##### Phase 5: Carrier Compensation (Notchify Carrier System)
1. **Payment Calculation**
   - Base carrier rate calculation
   - Fee adjustments (fuel, platform fees)
   - Total carrier payment amount determined

2. **Payment Processing**
   - Carrier payment method verification
   - Electronic payment processing (ACH, etc.)
   - Payment confirmation to carrier

3. **Completion Notification**
   - All systems updated with completion status
   - Final reconciliation and reporting
   - Workflow completion confirmation

    {
      "event": "load.created",
      "triggers": ["invoice.generate", "carrier.notify"],
      "data": "load_details"
    },
    {
      "event": "payment.completed",
      "triggers": ["invoice.mark_paid", "carrier_payment.schedule"],
      "data": "payment_details"
    },
    {
      "event": "delivery.confirmed",
      "triggers": ["invoice.finalize", "customer.notify"],
      "data": "delivery_details"
    }
  ]
}
