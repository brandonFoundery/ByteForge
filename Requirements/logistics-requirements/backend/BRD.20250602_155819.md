## Domain Services (BRD-3)

### Load Management Domain Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Load lifecycle management (draft → booked → in-transit → delivered)
- Multi-stop load configuration and routing
- Special equipment requirement handling
- Load cancellation and reuse logic
- Integration with tracking providers

**Key Operations:**
- `createLoad(loadRequest)` - Initialize new load booking
- `validateLoad(loadId)` - Ensure all required fields are complete
- `bookLoad(loadId, carrierId)` - Confirm load with carrier
- `cancelLoad(loadId, reason)` - Handle load cancellations
- `trackLoad(loadId)` - Get real-time status updates

### Carrier Management Domain Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Carrier onboarding workflow automation
- Insurance and authority verification
- Performance tracking and rating
- Communication preference management
- Compliance monitoring

**Key Operations:**
- `registerCarrier(carrierData)` - Initial carrier registration
- `verifyDocuments(carrierId, documents)` - Validate required paperwork
- `updateCarrierStatus(carrierId, status)` - Activate/deactivate carriers
- `searchCarriers(criteria)` - Find available carriers for loads
- `trackPerformance(carrierId)` - Monitor carrier metrics

### Rate Management Domain Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Dynamic pricing calculations
- Margin tracking and optimization
- Rate confirmation generation
- Historical rate analysis
- Market rate intelligence

**Key Operations:**
- `calculateRate(loadDetails, market)` - Determine competitive pricing
- `validateMargin(customerRate, carrierRate)` - Ensure profitability
- `generateRateConfirmation(loadId)` - Create carrier agreements
- `trackMarginPerformance()` - Analyze pricing effectiveness

## Business Logic (BRD-4)

### Load Booking Business Rules

**Validation Rules:**
- Cargo value must be specified for insurance purposes
- Delivery dates required to prevent fraud
- Rate agreements mandatory for loads over $1,000
- Carrier must have active status and proper insurance
- Multi-stop loads require special handling workflows

**Processing Logic:**
```pseudocode
function processLoadBooking(loadRequest):
    // 1. Validate customer information
    customer = validateCustomer(loadRequest.customerId)
    if (!customer.isActive) throw ValidationError("Inactive customer")
    
    // 2. Validate load details
    validateCargoSpecifications(loadRequest.cargo)
    validateLocationDetails(loadRequest.pickup, loadRequest.delivery)
    
    // 3. Handle special requirements
    if (loadRequest.isMultiStop) {
        configureMultiStopRouting(loadRequest)
    }
    
    // 4. Calculate pricing
    suggestedRate = calculateMarketRate(loadRequest)
    
    // 5. Create draft load
    load = createDraftLoad(loadRequest, suggestedRate)
    
    return load
```

### Carrier Selection Algorithm

**Matching Criteria:**
- Geographic proximity to pickup location
- Equipment type compatibility
- Performance history and ratings
- Insurance coverage adequacy
- Availability and capacity

**Selection Logic:**
```pseudocode
function findSuitableCarriers(loadRequirements):
    carriers = searchCarriers({
        location: withinRadius(loadRequirements.pickup, 100),
        equipment: matches(loadRequirements.trailerType),
        insurance: minimumCoverage(loadRequirements.cargoValue),
        status: "active"
    })
    
    // Rank by performance score
    rankedCarriers = carriers.sortBy(calculatePerformanceScore)
    
    return rankedCarriers.take(10) // Return top 10 matches
```

## Workflow Specifications (BRD-5)

### Load Booking Workflow

**Primary Flow:**
1. **Draft Creation** - Broker initializes load with customer details
2. **Location Setup** - Configure pickup/delivery addresses and timeframes
3. **Cargo Specification** - Define weight, dimensions, special requirements
4. **Documentation** - Upload rate agreements and special instructions
5. **Carrier Search** - Find and select appropriate transportation provider
6. **Rate Negotiation** - Agree on pricing with margin validation
7. **Confirmation** - Generate and send rate confirmation to carrier
8. **Activation** - Load becomes active for tracking and dispatch

**Exception Handling:**
- Incomplete data validation with specific error messages
- Carrier unavailability fallback to next best option
- Rate confirmation delivery failures with retry logic
- Load cancellation processing with reuse capability

### Carrier Onboarding Workflow

**Stages:**
1. **Registration** - Carrier submits basic company information
2. **Document Upload** - Required paperwork (insurance, authority, etc.)
3. **Verification** - Automated and manual validation processes
4. **Activation** - Carrier approved for load assignments
5. **Ongoing Monitoring** - Continuous compliance checking
