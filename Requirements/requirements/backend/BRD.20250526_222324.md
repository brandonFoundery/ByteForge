# Backend Requirements Document (BRD)
**Business Application Platform**
*Version: 1.0*
*Generated: 2025-05-26*

## 1. Overview (BRD-1)

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the backend architecture, services, and technical requirements for implementing the Business Application Platform, aligned with the FRD specifications.

### 1.2 Architecture Principles
- Microservices-based architecture
- Event-driven communication
- RESTful API design
- Domain-driven design patterns
- Secure by design

## 2. Service Architecture (BRD-2)

### 2.1 Core Services
| Service Name | Primary Responsibility | Dependencies |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Auth Service | User authentication and authorization | Identity Provider |
| Workflow Engine | Process automation and orchestration | Message Queue |
| Data Service | Data management and persistence | PostgreSQL |
| Analytics Service | Reporting and metrics | Data Service |
| Integration Hub | External system connectivity | API Gateway |

### 2.2 Technical Stack
```yaml
Backend:
  Runtime: Node.js 18+
  Framework: Express.js
  API: REST/GraphQL
Database:
  Primary: PostgreSQL 14+
  Cache: Redis
Messaging:
  Queue: RabbitMQ
  Events: Apache Kafka
```

## 3. Domain Services (BRD-3)

### 3.1 Authentication Service (BRD-3.1)
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- Password policies and MFA support

### 3.2 Workflow Engine (BRD-3.2)
- Workflow definition store
- State machine implementation
- Task scheduling and queuing
- Process monitoring and logging

### 3.3 Data Service (BRD-3.3)
- CRUD operations
- Data validation
- Audit logging
- Bulk operations support

## 4. Business Logic (BRD-4)

### 4.1 Core Business Rules
- User permission validation
- Workflow state transitions
- Data integrity constraints
- Business metrics calculations

### 4.2 Validation Rules
```typescript
interface ValidationRules {
  required: string[];
  numeric: string[];
  dateRanges: {
    field: string;
    min: Date;
    max: Date;
  }[];
}
```

## 5. Workflow Specifications (BRD-5)

### 5.1 Workflow States
- Draft
- Submitted
- In Review
- Approved
- Rejected
- Completed

### 5.2 State Transitions
```json
{
  "Draft": ["Submitted"],
  "Submitted": ["In Review", "Rejected"],
  "In Review": ["Approved", "Rejected"],
  "Approved": ["Completed"],
  "Rejected": ["Draft"]
}
```

## 6. Integration Requirements (BRD-6)

### 6.1 External Systems
- Identity Provider (OAuth2)
- Email Service (SMTP)
- File Storage (S3-compatible)
- Payment Gateway

### 6.2 API Standards
- RESTful endpoints
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- JSON payload format
- Standard error responses

## 7. Security Requirements (BRD-7)

### 7.1 Authentication
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect
- API key management
- Rate limiting
- IP whitelisting

### 7.2 Data Security
- End-to-end encryption
- Data masking
- Audit trails
- GDPR compliance

## 8. Performance Requirements (BRD-8)

### 8.1 Service Level Objectives
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| API Response Time | < 200ms (95th percentile) |
| System Availability | 99.9% |
| Concurrent Users | 10,000 |
| Transaction Rate | 1000 TPS |

### 8.2 Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Auto-scaling triggers
- Load balancing requirements
- Cache strategy

## 9. Monitoring and Logging (BRD-9)

### 9.1 Metrics
- Service health checks
- Performance metrics
- Business metrics
- Error rates

### 9.2 Logging Requirements
- Structured logging format
- Log levels and retention
- Trace correlation
- Error tracking

This BRD provides comprehensive technical specifications for implementing the backend services. Development teams should refer to this document for architectural decisions and implementation details while maintaining alignment with the FRD requirements.
