# Backend Requirements Document (BRD)
**Business Application Platform**
*Version: 1.0*
*Generated: 2025-05-26*


## 1. Overview (BRD-1)


### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the backend architecture, services, and technical requirements for implementing the Business Application Platform, aligned with the FRD specifications.


### 1.2 Architecture Principles
- Microservices-based architecture
- Event-driven communication
- RESTful API design
- Domain-driven design patterns
- Secure by design


## 2. Service Architecture (BRD-2)


### 2.1 Core Services
| Service Name | Primary Responsibility | Dependencies |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Auth Service | User authentication and authorization | Identity Provider |
| Workflow Engine | Process automation and orchestration | Message Queue |
| Data Service | Data management and persistence | PostgreSQL |
| Analytics Service | Reporting and metrics | Data Service |
| Integration Hub | External system connectivity | API Gateway |


### 2.2 Technical Stack
```yaml
Backend:
  Runtime: Node.js 18+
  Framework: Express.js
  API: REST/GraphQL
Database:
  Primary: PostgreSQL 14+
  Cache: Redis
Messaging:
  Queue: RabbitMQ
  Events: Apache Kafka
```


## 3. Domain Services (BRD-3)


### 3.1 Authentication Service (BRD-3.1)
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- Password policies and MFA support


### 3.2 Workflow Engine (BRD-3.2)
- Workflow definition store
- State machine implementation
- Task scheduling and queuing
- Process monitoring and logging


### 3.3 Data Service (BRD-3.3)
- CRUD operations
- Data validation
- Audit logging
- Bulk operations support


## 4. Business Logic (BRD-4)


### 4.1 Core Business Rules
- User permission validation
- Workflow state transitions
- Data integrity constraints
- Business metrics calculations


### 4.2 Validation Rules
```typescript
interface ValidationRules {
  required: string[];
  numeric: string[];
  dateRanges: {
    field: string;
    min: Date;
    max: Date;
  }[];
}
```


## 5. Workflow Specifications (BRD-5)


### 5.1 Workflow States
- Draft
- Submitted
- In Review
- Approved
- Rejected
- Completed


### 5.2 State Transitions
```json
{
  "Draft": ["Submitted"],
  "Submitted": ["In Review", "Rejected"],
  "In Review": ["Approved", "Rejected"],
  "Approved": ["Completed"],
  "Rejected": ["Draft"]
}
```


## 6. Integration Requirements (BRD-6)


### 6.1 External Systems
- Identity Provider (OAuth2)
- Email Service (SMTP)
- File Storage (S3-compatible)
- Payment Gateway


### 6.2 API Standards
- RESTful endpoints
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- JSON payload format
- Standard error responses


## 7. Security Requirements (BRD-7)

- API key management
- Rate limiting
- IP whitelisting


### 7.2 Data Security
- End-to-end encryption
- Data masking
- Audit trails
- GDPR compliance


## 8. Performance Requirements (BRD-8)


### 8.1 Service Level Objectives
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| API Response Time | < 200ms (95th percentile) |
| System Availability | 99.9% |
| Concurrent Users | 10,000 |
| Transaction Rate | 1000 TPS |


### 8.2 Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Auto-scaling triggers
- Load balancing requirements
- Cache strategy


## 9. Monitoring and Logging (BRD-9)


### 9.1 Metrics
- Service health checks
- Performance metrics
- Business metrics
- Error rates


### 9.2 Logging Requirements
- Structured logging format
- Log levels and retention
