Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Augmented Integrated Software Development and Workflow Management Platform


Version History

- Version: 1.2 (Final Draft)
- Date: July 23, 2025
- Status: Final Draft
- Changes from v1.1: Incorporated client portal structure with multi-client/multi-project hierarchy; added cloud deployment with API hooks for local dev event sending; specified Elsa for workflow engine and Hangfire for background processes; removed licensing and compliance references; confirmed relational database (PostgreSQL); reaffirmed C# ASP.NET Core backend; set risk scoring to static (fan-out based); updated ERD (replaced WORKSPACE with CLIENT); refined open questions/decisions; minimized NFR to focus on essentials.

Executive Summary

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines a unified, AI-augmented client portal platform that combines a Jira-Like Project Management Tool (JPMT) for issue tracking, visualization, and collaboration with an AI-Orchestrated Ticket Workflow System (AOTWS) for automated ticket progression, and integrates the Component Decomposition System (CDS) for real-time codebase intelligence. The platform serves as a client portal supporting multiple clients, each with multiple projects, redefining software development by connecting project management directly to source code, automating lifecycle stages with specialized AI agents, and providing human-in-the-loop (HITL) oversight for quality and accountability.
Key pillars:
1. Advanced Project Management: Feature-rich tracking and visualization (risk matrices, timelines, dashboards) across clients and projects.
2. AI-Powered Code Intelligence (AI-LOM via MCP): Living codebase model for decomposition, sync, and impact analysis.
3. AI-Orchestrated Workflow: Agent-driven automation from backlog to deployment, with configurable gating.
This addresses inefficiencies in traditional tools by automating repetitive tasks, understanding technical dependencies, and accelerating time-to-market.
Assumptions:
- Builds on existing platform APIs for authentication, notifications, and database.
- AI agents leverage models like Grok/Claude via MCP; GitHub/Azure integrations.
- Local execution for sensitive operations (e.g., repo cloning).
- Multi-tenant architecture (clients as top-level entities).
- Cloud deployment (e.g., Azure) with API hooks for local dev event integration.
- Development starts July 23, 2025; follow-up docs (e.g., tech specs, test plans) forthcoming.

1. Introduction & Vision


1.1 Vision

Create a next-generation client portal platform that fundamentally redefines software development. It will be an intelligent, self-aware system that deeply understands codebases, automates the lifecycle from idea to deployment, and empowers developers with insights and efficiency. Beyond passive tracking, it enables active AI-driven execution with robust HITL oversight, reducing manual effort and communication gaps, while supporting multiple clients each managing multiple projects.

1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional tools (e.g., Jira) are disconnected from code, requiring manual updates and lacking dependency awareness. This causes inefficiencies, slower delivery, and error-prone processes. Developers waste time on repetitive tasks, while PMs struggle with outdated views. For client portals, there's a need for segregated multi-client/project structures and seamless integration between local dev environments and cloud systems.

1.3 Proposed Solution

A unified client portal platform with:
- JPMT for planning/tracking across clients/projects.
- CDS for codebase decomposition and sync.
- AOTWS for agent-orchestrated workflows.
- AI enhancements (e.g., NLP intake, predictive analytics) for future phases.
- Cloud deployment with API hooks allowing local dev instances to send events (e.g., code changes, builds) to trigger cloud updates (e.g., issue status, dashboard refreshes).

2. Core Domain & Data Model

A unified model connects clients, projects, issues, code components, and workflow artifacts. Extended with multi-client hierarchy (clients as top-level containers for projects).

UI/UX Design Document: AI-Augmented Integrated Software Development and Workflow Management Client Portal


Version History

- Version: 1.0
- Date: July 23, 2025
- Authors: Grok (xAI), based on platform PRD v1.2
- Purpose: This document outlines a comprehensive UI/UX strategy for the client portal platform, focusing on seamless, intuitive experiences for Admins (platform-wide managers) and Clients (per-client users). It incorporates best practices from industry research, emphasizing simplicity, personalization, security, and efficiency to drive engagement, reduce friction, and support multi-client/multi-project hierarchies.

Executive Summary

The UI/UX design for this client portal prioritizes user-centric principles to create an engaging, efficient experience. Drawing from best practices in SaaS dashboards and client portals (e.g., intuitive navigation, responsive layouts, customizable views, and self-service tools), the design ensures Admins can oversee operations across clients/projects, while Clients enjoy personalized, secure access to their data. Key goals:
- Engagement: Reduce cognitive load with clean, minimalistic interfaces and contextual guidance.
- Efficiency: Streamline workflows with AI-assisted features, real-time updates, and mobile-first responsiveness.
- Security & Trust: Visible security cues and role-based access to build confidence.
- Scalability: Support multi-client structures with customizable dashboards.
This design evolves the PRD's functional requirements into user flows, screens, and interactions, ensuring a "much better" experience through thoughtful onboarding, personalization, and feedback loops.

1. Design Principles

Guided by industry best practices (e.g., minimalism from Jira/Asana, personalization from Salesforce, security from banking portals):
- Simplicity & Clarity: Use white space, consistent typography (e.g., sans-serif fonts like Inter), and limited color palettes (primary: blue for actions, green for success, red for alerts).
- Mobile-First Responsiveness: All screens adapt to devices; prioritize vertical scrolling on mobile.
- Personalization: Dynamic content based on user role, preferences, and history (e.g., customizable widgets).
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliance (e.g., alt text, keyboard navigation, high contrast modes).
- Intuitiveness: Follow familiar patterns (e.g., hamburger menus, search bars with autosuggest).
- Feedback & Guidance: Tooltips, progress indicators, and AI-driven hints (e.g., "Suggested next action: Review new ticket").
- Security Visualization: Icons for encrypted data, audit logs, and MFA prompts.
- Performance: Fast load times (<2s per screen); lazy loading for dashboards.

2. User Personas


2.1 Admin Persona

- Name/Age/Demographics: Alex Rivera, 35, Platform Administrator at a mid-sized dev agency.
- Goals: Manage multiple clients/projects, monitor platform health, onboard new clients, analyze cross-client metrics, resolve issues.
- Pain Points: Overwhelmed by data silos, slow client onboarding, lack of real-time oversight.
- Behaviors: Frequent logins (daily), uses desktop primarily, needs advanced analytics and bulk actions.
- Tech Savvy: High; expects customizable views and integrations.

2.2 Client Persona

- Name/Age/Demographics: Jordan Lee, 28, Project Manager at a client company.
- Goals: Access project dashboards, collaborate on tickets, view AI-generated insights, self-serve resources without support tickets.
- Pain Points: Delayed responses, confusing navigation, insecure file sharing, lack of mobile access.
- Behaviors: Occasional logins (weekly), mobile/desktop mix, prefers self-service and notifications.
- Tech Savvy: Medium; needs intuitive interfaces with guidance.

3. Navigation Structure

- Global Navigation: Top bar with logo (links to home), search bar (autosuggest for projects/tickets), notifications bell (real-time alerts), user avatar (profile/settings/logout).
- Sidebar (Left): Collapsible; role-based:
  
  Admin: Clients List, Projects Overview, Analytics, Users/Roles, Settings.
  Client: My Projects, Dashboards, Tickets, Resources/KB, Support.
