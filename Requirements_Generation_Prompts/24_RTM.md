## Chain-of-Thought Instructions

When creating the RTM:
1. Collect all requirement IDs
2. Map parent-child relationships
3. Link to design and implementation
4. Connect test cases
5. Calculate coverage
6. Identify gaps
7. Analyze impacts
8. Validate consistency
```

## Iterative Refinement Prompts

### Refinement Round 1: Completeness
```markdown
Review the RTM and enhance it by:
1. Finding all missing links
2. Identifying orphan artifacts
3. Completing status updates
4. Adding missing test references
5. Validating ID consistency
```

### Refinement Round 2: Analysis
```markdown
Refine the RTM by:
1. Calculating detailed metrics
2. Performing gap analysis
3. Creating impact assessments
4. Identifying critical paths
5. Analyzing dependencies
```

### Refinement Round 3: Actionability
```markdown
Enhance the RTM by:
1. Prioritizing gaps for closure
2. Creating action items
3. Setting coverage targets
4. Defining improvement plans
5. Establishing review cycles

## Iterative Requirements Elicitation

After generating the initial Requirements Traceability Matrix, perform a comprehensive analysis to identify gaps, ambiguities, and areas requiring clarification. Create a structured list of questions for the client that will help refine and complete the RTM requirements.

### 6. Client Clarification Questions

Think critically about requirement relationships, coverage analysis, impact assessment, change management, and verification that might not have been fully considered or might be unclear. Generate specific, actionable questions organized by category:

```yaml
id: RTM-QUESTION-001
category: [Traceability Links|Coverage Analysis|Impact Assessment|Change Management|Verification|Gap Analysis|Other]
question: [Specific question for the client]
rationale: [Why this question is important for RTM success]
related_requirements: [RTM-XXX, BRD-REQ-XXX, or PRD-FEAT-XXX references if applicable]
priority: High|Medium|Low
expected_impact: [How the answer will affect the RTM requirements]
```

#### Question Categories:

**RTM-Specific Questions:**
- Clarifications on requirement relationships, traceability coverage, change impact, and verification status
- Edge cases and exception scenarios
- Integration and dependency requirements
- Performance and quality expectations
- Compliance and governance needs

### Instructions for Question Generation:

1. **Be Specific**: Ask precise questions that will yield actionable answers
2. **Prioritize Impact**: Focus on questions that will significantly affect RTM requirements
3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about unusual scenarios and exceptions
4. **Validate Assumptions**: Question any assumptions made in the initial requirements
5. **Ensure Completeness**: Look for gaps in requirement relationships, traceability coverage, change impact, and verification status
6. **Think Downstream**: Consider how answers will affect implementation
7. **Maintain Traceability**: Link questions to specific requirements when applicable

### Answer Integration Process:

When client answers are received, they should be integrated back into the Requirements Traceability Matrix using this process:

1. **Create Answer Records**:
```yaml
id: RTM-ANSWER-001
question_id: RTM-QUESTION-001
answer: [Client's response]
provided_by: [Stakeholder name/role]
date_received: YYYY-MM-DD
impact_assessment: [How this affects existing requirements]
```

2. **Update Affected Requirements**: Modify existing requirements based on answers
3. **Create New Requirements**: Add new requirements identified through answers
4. **Update Traceability**: Ensure all changes maintain proper traceability links
5. **Document Changes**: Track what was modified and why

This iterative approach ensures comprehensive RTM requirements that address all critical aspects and reduce implementation risks.

```
