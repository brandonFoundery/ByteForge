# Reviewer Prompt Templates

## Overview

This directory contains reviewer prompt templates for the dual-LLM system. These prompts are used by the **Reviewer LLM** (typically Gemini) to review documents generated by the **Primary LLM** (typically OpenAI) and generate additional clarification questions.

## Dual-Prompt Architecture

### Primary LLM Prompts (Generation + Questions)
- **Location**: `../` (parent directory)
- **Purpose**: Generate initial documents with initial clarification questions
- **Focus**: Requirements gathering, initial analysis, comprehensive coverage

### Reviewer LLM Prompts (Review + Questions)
- **Location**: This directory
- **Purpose**: Review generated documents and generate validation/improvement questions
- **Focus**: Quality assurance, consistency validation, enhancement opportunities

## Reviewer Prompt Structure

Each reviewer prompt follows this structure:

1. **Review Instructions**: How to analyze the generated document
2. **Quality Criteria**: What to look for in the review
3. **Improvement Guidelines**: How to enhance the document
4. **Question Generation**: Generate additional clarification questions
5. **Output Format**: Structure for the reviewed document

## Question Generation Philosophy

### Primary LLM Questions Focus On:
- Initial requirements gathering
- Identifying missing concepts
- Understanding business context
- Exploring functional needs

### Reviewer LLM Questions Focus On:
- Validating existing requirements
- Identifying inconsistencies
- Exploring edge cases missed
- Ensuring implementation feasibility
- Checking compliance and standards
- Verifying traceability completeness

## File Naming Convention

- `Review_01_BRD.md` - Business Requirements Document Reviewer
- `Review_02_PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document Reviewer
- `Review_04_FRD.md` - Functional Requirements Document Reviewer
- `Review_05_NFRD.md` - Non-Functional Requirements Document Reviewer
- `Review_07_DRD.md` - Data Requirements Document Reviewer
- `Review_08_DB_Schema.md` - Database Schema Document Reviewer
- `Review_09_TRD.md` - Technical Requirements Document Reviewer
- `Review_10_API_OpenAPI.md` - API Specification Document Reviewer
- `Review_11_UIUX_Spec.md` - UI/UX Specification Document Reviewer
- `Review_20_Test_Plan.md` - Test Plan Document Reviewer
- `Review_24_RTM.md` - Requirements Traceability Matrix Reviewer

## Usage in Dual-LLM System

1. **Primary LLM** generates document using primary prompts
2. **Reviewer LLM** reviews document using reviewer prompts
3. **Both sets of questions** are presented to client
4. **Client answers** are integrated with full traceability
5. **Final document** incorporates both perspectives

## Question Categories

### Primary Questions (from generation prompts)
- Business process clarifications
- Functional requirement gaps
- Data and integration needs
- Stakeholder role definitions

### Reviewer Questions (from review prompts)
- Requirement validation and verification
- Implementation feasibility checks
- Consistency and completeness validation
- Quality and standards compliance
- Risk and edge case identification

## Benefits of Dual-Question Approach

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Two different perspectives ensure thorough analysis
2. **Quality Assurance**: Reviewer questions catch issues missed in initial generation
3. **Validation Focus**: Reviewer questions specifically validate and verify requirements
4. **Implementation Readiness**: Reviewer questions ensure requirements are implementable
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Two-stage questioning reduces project risks significantly

## Integration with Answer Process

Both primary and reviewer questions use the same answer integration process:

```yaml
# Primary LLM Questions
id: {DOC_TYPE}-QUESTION-001
source: primary_llm
category: [Category]
question: [Question text]
# ... rest of structure

# Reviewer LLM Questions  
id: {DOC_TYPE}-REVIEW-QUESTION-001
source: reviewer_llm
category: [Category]
question: [Question text]
# ... rest of structure
```

This ensures full traceability while distinguishing between question sources.
