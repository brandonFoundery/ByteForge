## Iterative Requirements Elicitation

After generating the initial {config['doc_full_name']}, perform a comprehensive analysis to identify gaps, ambiguities, and areas requiring clarification. Create a structured list of questions for the client that will help refine and complete the {config['doc_type']} requirements.

### {config['section_number']}. Client Clarification Questions

Think critically about {config['focus_areas']} that might not have been fully considered or might be unclear. Generate specific, actionable questions organized by category:

```yaml
id: {config['doc_type']}-QUESTION-001
category: [{config['categories']}]
question: [Specific question for the client]
rationale: [Why this question is important for {config['doc_type']} success]
related_requirements: [{config['related_refs']} references if applicable]
priority: High|Medium|Low
expected_impact: [How the answer will affect the {config['doc_type']} requirements]
```

#### Question Categories:

**{config['doc_type']}-Specific Questions:**
- Clarifications on {config['specific_areas']}
- Edge cases and exception scenarios
- Integration and dependency requirements
- Performance and quality expectations
- Compliance and governance needs

### Instructions for Question Generation:

1. **Be Specific**: Ask precise questions that will yield actionable answers
2. **Prioritize Impact**: Focus on questions that will significantly affect {config['doc_type']} requirements
3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about unusual scenarios and exceptions
4. **Validate Assumptions**: Question any assumptions made in the initial requirements
5. **Ensure Completeness**: Look for gaps in {config['specific_areas']}
6. **Think Downstream**: Consider how answers will affect implementation
7. **Maintain Traceability**: Link questions to specific requirements when applicable

### Answer Integration Process:

When client answers are received, they should be integrated back into the {config['doc_full_name']} using this process:

1. **Create Answer Records**:
```yaml
id: {config['doc_type']}-ANSWER-001
question_id: {config['doc_type']}-QUESTION-001
answer: [Client's response]
provided_by: [Stakeholder name/role]
date_received: YYYY-MM-DD
impact_assessment: [How this affects existing requirements]
```

2. **Update Affected Requirements**: Modify existing requirements based on answers
3. **Create New Requirements**: Add new requirements identified through answers
4. **Update Traceability**: Ensure all changes maintain proper traceability links
5. **Document Changes**: Track what was modified and why

This iterative approach ensures comprehensive {config['doc_type']} requirements that address all critical aspects and reduce implementation risks.
