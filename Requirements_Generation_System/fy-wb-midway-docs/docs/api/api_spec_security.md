# API Security Schemes and Authentication

This document defines the security schemes and authentication patterns for the FY.WB.Midway Enterprise Logistics Platform API.

## Security Schemes

        JWT token-based authentication for secure API access.

        - Tokens are issued upon successful authentication
        - Tokens include user identity and permissions
        - Tokens expire after a configurable period
        - Refresh tokens are supported for seamless renewal

## Global Security Configuration

All API endpoints require authentication by default using JWT bearer tokens.
