# Development Plan: LSOMigrator

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview and Development Approach
This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for the **LSOMigrator** project, a modern, cloud-native freight and logistics management platform. The objective is to deliver a scalable, secure, and user-friendly system that streamlines operations for load management, customer and carrier interactions, invoicing, and payment processing.

Our development approach is grounded in the **Agile/Scrum methodology**, utilizing 2-week sprints to facilitate iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to changing requirements. The technical foundation will be a **CLEAN Architecture** with a **CQRS pattern** to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and performance.

### 1.2 Key Development Principles and Methodologies
- **Agile/Scrum:** Iterative development in 2-week sprints, with standard ceremonies (planning, daily stand-up, review, retrospective).
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests before application code to ensure quality and guide development.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps to ensure rapid and reliable delivery.
- **Mandatory Code Reviews:** All code merged into the `dev` branch must be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer to maintain code quality and share knowledge.
- **Cloud-Native:** Leveraging Azure services for scalability, reliability, and security.

### 1.3 High-Level Timeline and Milestones
The project is divided into four distinct phases, with estimated durations:
- **Milestone 1 (M1): Phase 1 - MVP/Foundation Complete:** (Est. 6 Sprints / 12 Weeks) - Core platform is operational.
- **Milestone 2 (M2): Phase 2 - Core Features Complete:** (Est. 5 Sprints / 10 Weeks) - Full end-to-end load lifecycle is supported.
- **Milestone 3 (M3): Phase 3 - Enhanced Features Complete:** (Est. 4 Sprints / 8 Weeks) - Monetization and advanced reporting are enabled.
- **Milestone 4 (M4): Phase 4 - Advanced Features Complete:** (Est. 3 Sprints / 6 Weeks) - Platform is feature-rich and competitive.

### 1.4 Success Criteria and Deliverables
Successful project completion is defined by the delivery of a fully functional platform that meets all requirements outlined in the PRD, FRD, and NFRD.
- **Key Deliverable:** A production-ready, multi-tenant SaaS platform deployed on Azure.

### 3.2 Data and Component Dependencies
- **Shared User Model:** `F-01 (Auth)` provides the user identity for all other features.
- **Shared Load Entity:** `F-04 (Load CRUD)` is the central data entity, depended upon by `F-08 (Carrier Portal)`, `F-09 (Invoicing)`, `F-14 (Doc Mgmt)`, and `F-15 (Reporting)`.
- **Shared Customer Entity:** `F-06 (Customer CRUD)` is required before invoices (`F-09`) can be assigned.
- **Shared Carrier Entity:** `F-07 (Carrier Mgmt)` is required before loads can be assigned or viewed in the portal (`F-08`).
- **UI Component Library:** A shared library of Next.js/Tailwind components must be developed early to ensure UI consistency.

### 3.3 Infrastructure and Platform Dependencies
- **Azure SQL Database:** Must be provisioned and schema designed before backend development can proceed on data-dependent features.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** Required for `F-14 (Document Management)`.
- **Azure App Service/AKS:** The compute environment must be configured for CI/CD integration (`F-03`).
- **Azure Key Vault:** Required for secure management of secrets for `F-01 (Auth)` and `F-11 (Payment Gateway)`.

### 3.4 Third-Party Integration Dependencies
- **Stripe API:** `F-11 (Payment Gateway)` is entirely dependent on the Stripe API. A developer sandbox account must be set up during Phase 1 for early testing.

## 4. Development Phases

## 5. Parallel Work Stream Identification

To accelerate delivery, development will be organized into parallel streams. API contracts (using OpenAPI/Swagger) will be the key enabler for concurrent work.

| Phase | Frontend (Next.js) | Backend (ASP.NET Core) | Database/Infrastructure (Azure) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | - Auth UI (Login, Register)<br>- Load Management UI (CRUD forms, list view)<br>- Initial UI Component Library | - Identity/Auth Service<br>- Load Management API (Commands/Queries)<br>- Define initial API contracts | - Provision Core Azure Resources<br>- Setup CI/CD Pipeline<br>- Initial DB Schema design & migration |
| **Phase 2** | - Customer Management UI<br>- Carrier Portal UI (Load list, details)<br>- Invoice Viewing UI | - Customer & Carrier APIs<br>- Invoice Generation Service<br>- Carrier Portal API endpoints<br>- Audit Logging implementation | - DB Schema updates for Customers, Carriers, Invoices<br>- Configure role-based access control (RBAC) |

| **Phase 4** | - Carrier Bidding UI<br>- Custom Report Builder UI | - Bidding System Logic (Commands/Queries)<br>- Advanced Analytics API | - DB Schema for Bids<br>- Indexing strategy for analytics performance |

## 6. Feature Branch Strategy

A consistent branching strategy is crucial for managing parallel development and maintaining a stable codebase.

### 6.1 Branch Naming Conventions
All feature development must occur in branches created from the `dev` branch. The naming convention is strictly enforced:
- **Customer:** `feature/customer-management-{feature-id}` (e.g., `feature/customer-management-F-06`)
- **Payment:** `feature/payment-processing-{feature-id}` (e.g., `feature/payment-processing-F-11`)
- **Load:** `feature/load-management-{feature-id}` (e.g., `feature/load-management-F-04`)
- **Invoice:** `feature/invoice-processing-{feature-id}` (e.g., `feature/invoice-processing-F-09`)
- **Carrier:** `feature/carrier-portal-{feature-id}` (e.g., `feature/carrier-portal-F-07`)
- **Reporting:** `feature/reporting-analytics-{feature-id}` (e.g., `feature/reporting-analytics-F-15`)
- **Infrastructure:** `feature/infrastructure-{feature-id}` (e.g., `feature/infrastructure-F-02`)
- **Security:** `feature/security-compliance-{feature-id}` (e.g., `feature/security-compliance-F-01`)

### 6.2 Feature Branch Lifecycle
1.  **Create:** Create a new feature branch from the latest `dev`.
2.  **Develop:** Implement the feature and associated unit/integration tests on the branch.
3.  **Push:** Push commits to the remote feature branch frequently.
4.  **Pull Request (PR):** When the feature is complete and tested locally, open a PR to merge into `dev`. The PR must link to the relevant work item in Azure DevOps.
5.  **Review:** The PR must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. The automated CI build (including tests) must pass.
6.  **Merge:** Once approved, the branch is merged into `dev` using a squash merge to maintain a clean history.
7.  **Delete:** The feature branch is deleted from the remote repository after the merge.

## 7. Timeline Estimates

Estimates are provided in Story Points (SP) to represent effort, complexity, and uncertainty. A 20% buffer is included in the phase totals. (Assume team velocity of 20 SP/sprint).

## 9. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RISK-01** | Technical | The complexity of implementing the CQRS pattern correctly leads to over-engineering or performance issues. | Medium | High | - Conduct a spike/PoC in Sprint 0/1.<br>- Ensure senior backend dev leads the architectural design.<br>- Regular architectural reviews. |
| **RISK-02** | Schedule | Third-party payment gateway integration (Stripe) is more complex than anticipated, delaying Phase 3. | Medium | Medium | - Set up a developer sandbox account in Phase 1.<br>- Assign a developer to build a PoC of the integration early in the project.<br>- Allocate buffer time specifically for this feature. |
| **RISK-03** | Resource | Loss of a key developer (e.g., senior frontend or backend) slows down a work stream significantly. | Low | High | - Enforce pair programming on complex features.<br>- Maintain high-quality documentation for all code and architecture.<br>- Ensure PRs are used for knowledge sharing. |
| **RISK-04** | Integration | Discrepancies between frontend and backend implementations due to misaligned API contracts. | Medium | Medium | - Adopt an API-first design approach.<br>- Use OpenAPI/Swagger to generate and share API contracts before implementation begins.<br>- Implement automated contract testing in the CI pipeline. |
| **RISK-05** | Scope | Uncontrolled scope creep extends the timeline and budget. | High | High | - Adhere strictly to the defined backlog and priorities.<br>- The Product Owner is the sole authority for accepting new work into a sprint.<br>- All changes must go through a formal change request process. |

## 10. Integration and Deployment Strategy

### 10.1 Continuous Integration Approach
- Every `git push` to a feature branch will trigger a CI build in Azure DevOps.
- The CI build will:
    1. Restore dependencies (npm, NuGet).
    2. Compile the code (frontend and backend).
    3. Run all unit tests.
    4. Run static code analysis.
    5. Package the build artifacts.
- A PR merge into `dev` requires a successful CI build.

### 10.2 Environment Strategy
1.  **Development (`dev`):** Automatically deployed from the `dev` branch after a successful merge. Used by developers for integration and informal testing.
2.  **Testing (`test`):** Manually promoted from `dev`. Used by QA for formal test plan execution, E2E testing, and regression testing.
3.  **Staging (`staging`):** Manually promoted from `test`. A production-like environment for UAT, performance testing, and final sign-off from stakeholders. Uses a restored copy of the production database.
4.  **Production (`prod`):** Manually promoted from `staging` after successful UAT. This is the live environment for customers.

    style K fill:#d0f0c0,stroke:#333
    style N fill:#f9f3cf,stroke:#333

### 10.4 Rollback and Recovery Procedures
- All deployments to `staging` and `prod` will use a blue-green deployment strategy managed by Azure App Service deployment slots.
- If a critical issue is found post-deployment, a rollback can be performed instantly by swapping the `staging` and `production` slots back to the previous version.
- Database migrations will be designed to be backward-compatible for at least one version to support this rollback strategy. Any breaking schema change will require a more detailed, specific deployment plan.
