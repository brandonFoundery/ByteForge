An excellent Data Requirements Document (DRD) forms the blueprint for a system's data architecture, ensuring that data is modeled, stored, managed, and secured in a way that meets business needs and technical constraints. My review focuses on transforming this DRD from a high-level sketch into a detailed, robust, and implementable specification. I have enhanced it by introducing missing core entities (like Users, Resources, and Workflows), clarifying relationships, defining data structures with greater precision, and adding critical non-functional requirements for performance, governance, and security.

This enhanced version provides the necessary detail for data architects to design the database, for developers to build data access layers, and for QA engineers to write effective data validation tests.
