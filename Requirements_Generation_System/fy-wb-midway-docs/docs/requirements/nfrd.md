## ENHANCED DOCUMENT:

# Non-Functional Requirements Document

## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFRD) is to delineate the quality attributes, performance benchmarks, and operational constraints essential for the LSOMigrator platform. This document is intended to ensure that the platform not only meets the functional requirements specified in the [FRD] but also aligns with the strategic business objectives from the [BRD], technical constraints, and compliance mandates outlined in the [PRD]. These requirements are critical for delivering a reliable, secure, and high-performing system.

### Scope
This document encompasses the non-functional attributes of the LSOMigrator platform, including performance, scalability, security, usability, reliability, maintainability, and compliance. It establishes a framework for designing, implementing, and validating the system's quality attributes through quantifiable and testable criteria. These requirements apply to the entire platform, including all microservices, APIs, and user-facing applications.

## REVIEWER CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS

### Validation Questions
1.  **NFRD-5.2 (Disaster Recovery):** Are the proposed RTO of 4 hours and RPO of 1 hour acceptable to our target manufacturing and retail customers, who may have near-zero tolerance for data loss or downtime during peak operational hours? Have we validated these targets against customer business continuity expectations?
2.  **NFRD-1.1 (Performance):** The 5,000 concurrent user target is a key benchmark. How was this number derived? Does it represent the anticipated load for our first 12-18 months of operation, and does it account for the workload mix (e.g., 80% analytics dashboard views, 20% resource management updates)?
3.  **NFRD-6.1 (Compliance):** The document targets GDPR and SOC 2 Type II. Are there other industry-specific regulations for manufacturing or retail (e.g., PCI DSS if payment processing is ever in scope) that we should consider for the architectural foundation, even if not for the initial release?

### Consistency Questions
1.  **PRD vs. NFRD Latency:** The enhanced PRD v1.1 specifies "data latency under 15 seconds," which has been adopted in NFRD-1.2. The original NFRD draft mentioned 500ms. Can we confirm that 15 seconds is the definitive requirement for the analytics pipeline and that all stakeholders understand this is near-real-time, not instantaneous?
2.  **PRD-8.2 vs. NFRD Scope:** The PRD mentions a 6-month development timeline and a fixed budget. The NFRs for automated scaling (NFRD-2.1), disaster recovery (NFRD-5.2), and SOC 2 audit readiness (NFRD-6.1) imply significant infrastructure and process maturity. Is there a potential conflict between the scope of these NFRs and the initial project constraints? Should some of these be phased for a post-MVP release?

### Implementation Questions
1.  **NFRD-2.1 (Scalability):** The requirement for automated, zero-downtime scaling implies a robust container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) and CI/CD platform. Are these foundational technologies accounted for in our tech stack and team skill set?
2.  **NFRD-6.2 (Auditability):** An immutable audit log can have significant storage and performance implications. What is the proposed technical solution for implementing this (e.g., write-once storage, blockchain-inspired ledgers, or a managed service like AWS QLDB)?
3.  **NFRD-3.1 (Encryption):** The requirement for a dedicated Key Management Service (KMS) is a best practice. Will we use a cloud provider's native KMS (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault), or is there a requirement for a hardware security module (HSM) or a self-hosted solution?

### Quality Questions
1.  **NFRD-4.2 (Accessibility):** How will we ensure ongoing WCAG 2.1 AA compliance? Will this involve integrating automated accessibility checks into the CI/CD pipeline, periodic manual audits using assistive technologies, and training for developers and designers?
2.  **NFRD-1.1 (Performance Metrics):** The requirement specifies the 95th percentile response time. What is our strategy for performance testing? Will we define and script specific user journeys that represent "critical transactions" to ensure our load tests accurately reflect real-world usage patterns?
3.  **NFRD-5.2 (Disaster Recovery):** How will the RTO/RPO targets be tested and verified? Does this involve planned biannual failover drills where we simulate a regional outage and measure the actual time to recovery and data loss?
