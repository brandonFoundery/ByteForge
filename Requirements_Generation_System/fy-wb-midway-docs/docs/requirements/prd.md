## User Stories (PRD-6)

### Resource Management Epic
As an operations manager,
I want to efficiently allocate resources and track inventory in real-time,
So that I can reduce waste and enhance productivity effectively.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can view a dashboard showing the current status and location of all tracked inventory items.
- I can create, assign, and track tasks for both personnel and equipment.
- The system automatically suggests resource assignments based on pre-configured rules (e.g., availability, skill level).

### Performance Analytics Epic
As an operations manager,
I want to access real-time performance data and predictive insights,
So that I can make informed decisions and improve operational efficiency.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can create a custom dashboard by selecting from a library of widgets (e.g., line charts, bar graphs, KPI cards).
- I can view a predictive forecast for next month's product demand with a stated accuracy of +/- 15%.
- I can generate a performance report for a specific production line over a selected time period.
- I can configure and receive email or in-app notifications when a key performance metric deviates from its target by more than 10%.

## Success Metrics (PRD-7)

### Key Performance Indicators
1. User Engagement
   - Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Daily Active Users (DAU) to measure user interaction.
   - Rate of feature utilization (e.g., % of users who have created a custom dashboard; # of automated rules configured per client).
   - Average session duration and number of sessions per user per week to evaluate user engagement.

2. Business Impact
   - Measurable improvement in client resource allocation efficiency (e.g., % increase in machine uptime, % reduction in overtime hours).
   - Average reduction in process cycle times for key client workflows (e.g., order-to-cash, procure-to-pay).
   - Quantifiable increase in client productivity metrics (e.g., units produced per hour, orders fulfilled per day).

## Assumptions & Constraints (PRD-8)

### Technical Assumptions
- The platform will be compatible with the latest two major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Users will have access to a stable broadband internet connection (minimum 5 Mbps download) for optimal performance.
- Documented APIs for key third-party systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) will be available and accessible for integration.

### Constraints
- **PRD-8.1**: Technical
  - The platform will be built on a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture (e.g., using Docker, Kubernetes) to support scalability and resilience.
  - It will incorporate AI and machine learning models for predictive analytics; a "build vs. buy" analysis is required for the core ML engine.
  - All data will be encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3), and the platform must be designed for SOC 2 and GDPR compliance.

- **PRD-8.2**: Business
  - The development cycle for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is restricted to a 9-month timeframe.
  - Budget constraints must align with financial forecasts; any significant deviation requires re-approval from the steering committee.
  - The solution must comply with industry-specific regulations for manufacturing and retail sectors (e.g., GDPR for customer data, relevant ISO standards).

### Dependencies
1. Timely completion of integration partnerships and access to technical documentation for target ERP and CRM systems.
2. Availability of clean, historical client data for training and validating AI and analytics models.
3. Infrastructure (e.g., cloud provider services) must be provisioned and configured to be scalable to support projected user growth and data volume.

This PRD serves as the foundation for subsequent detailed design and technical specifications. All development and implementation efforts should align with these requirements and business objectives to ensure successful deployment and adoption.

## Reviewer Clarification Questions

### Validation Questions
1.  **User Journey:** The PRD focuses on the Operations Manager and IT Specialist. Have we considered the end-to-end user journey, including other potential users like floor supervisors, inventory clerks, or finance analysts who might interact with the system? Are their needs adequately covered by the current personas?
2.  **MVP Scope:** The "Must-Have" features are broad. To meet the 9-month timeline, what is the absolute minimum functionality within "Resource Management" and "Performance Analytics" that would deliver on the core value proposition for our first 10 clients?
3.  **Competitive Landscape:** The differentiation points are strong. Can we identify 2-3 key competitors and map our "Must-Have" features against theirs to confirm we have a compelling offering at launch? Are there any "table stakes" features we might be missing?
4.  **Value Proposition Testability:** How will we concretely measure the "50% reduction in operational overhead" and "70% improvement in resource utilization"? What are the specific baseline metrics we need to capture from clients during onboarding to prove this ROI?

### Consistency Questions
1.  **Feature vs. Timeline:** The "Must-Have" features include complex items like "predictive analytics" and "automated resource allocation," while the "Should-Have" list includes "seamless integration with ERP/CRM." Is it realistic to deliver all must-haves, which require significant R&D, within the 9-month MVP timeline? Should core integrations be considered a "Must-Have" to achieve the stated business impact?
2.  **Target Market Alignment:** The PRD targets both manufacturing and retail. Do these sectors have conflicting or significantly different requirements for resource management (e.g., machinery/OEE vs. shelf space/inventory turnover)? Does the MVP feature set adequately serve both, or should we prioritize one for the initial launch?
3.  **AI/ML Dependency:** The competitive differentiation and functional requirements heavily rely on AI/ML. However, a dependency is "availability of clean, historical client data." How will the predictive features function for a brand-new client with no historical data? Is there a "cold start" strategy?

### Implementation Questions
1.  **Build vs. Buy:** For PRD-8.1, a "build vs. buy" analysis is mentioned for the ML engine. What are the decision criteria and deadline for this analysis? This decision will have a major impact on the architecture, timeline, and budget.
2.  **Integration Strategy:** For PRD-5.3, we list specific ERP/CRM systems. Given the complexity of these integrations, will the MVP launch with pre-built connectors for 1-2 key systems, or will it rely solely on the public API for custom integrations?
3.  **Scalability Targets:** The infrastructure is required to be scalable (PRD-8 Dependencies). Can we define specific performance and scalability targets for the MVP launch? For example, "support 1,000 concurrent users with an average API response time of <200ms."
4.  **Data Security:** PRD-8.1 mentions SOC 2 and GDPR compliance. What is the plan and timeline for achieving this? Will we pursue certification post-launch, or are there specific controls that must be in place for the MVP?

### Quality Questions
1.  **Testability of Analytics:** How will we test the accuracy of the "predictive analytics" (PRD-5.2)? What is the acceptable margin of error, and what is the QA strategy for validating the ML models both before and after deployment?
2.  **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** The PRD implies NFRs like performance (latency <15s), availability, and security. Should we create a dedicated section for NFRs to explicitly define targets for uptime (e.g., 99.9%), data recovery (RPO/RTO), and page load times?
3.  **Acceptance Criteria Depth:** The acceptance criteria in PRD-6 are a good start. Should we expand these into more detailed BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) scenarios to cover edge cases, negative paths, and specific data validations before development begins?
4.  **Client Onboarding & Data Import:** PRD-5.3 mentions data import. What is the quality assurance process for client data migration? How will we handle data validation, cleaning, and error resolution during the onboarding process to ensure the platform's analytics are accurate from day one?
