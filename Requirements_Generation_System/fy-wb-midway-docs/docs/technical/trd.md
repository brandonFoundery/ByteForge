# Technical Requirements Document - FY.WB.Midway

## Overview

This is the master document for the FY.WB.Midway Enterprise Logistics Platform Technical Requirements. The complete technical specification is organized into multiple linked documents for better maintainability and navigation.

## Executive Summary

The FY.WB.Midway platform is designed as a cloud-native, microservices-based enterprise logistics solution that provides secure, scalable, and high-performance operations for customer management, payment processing, load booking, and invoice generation.

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Architecture**: Microservices with API Gateway pattern
- **Technology Stack**: Java/Spring Boot backend, React frontend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes on AWS
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0/JWT with comprehensive security layers

## Document Structure

The complete technical requirements are organized into the following documents:

### Core Architecture
- **[System Architecture](./trd_architecture.md)** - High-level architecture, design decisions, and component relationships
- **[Technology Stack](./trd_technology_stack.md)** - Technology selections, frameworks, and component design

### Cross-cutting Concerns
- **[Security Architecture](./trd_security.md)** - Security layers, threat model, and compliance requirements
- **[Performance Engineering](./trd_performance.md)** - Performance targets, optimization strategies, and caching

### Infrastructure and Operations
- **[Infrastructure Requirements](./trd_infrastructure.md)** - Compute, network, and deployment architecture
- **[Operational Requirements](./trd_operations.md)** - Monitoring, deployment, and DevOps practices

## Architecture Principles

1. **Microservices First**: Clear domain boundaries with independent scaling
2. **API-First Design**: All interactions through well-defined APIs
3. **Cloud-Native**: Designed for containerized, orchestrated environments
4. **Security by Design**: Security integrated at every architectural layer
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing
6. **DevOps Integration**: Automated CI/CD with infrastructure as code
