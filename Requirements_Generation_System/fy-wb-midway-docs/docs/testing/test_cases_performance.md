# Performance Test Cases

## Performance Testing Strategy

### Test Types
- **Load Testing**: Normal expected load
- **Stress Testing**: Beyond normal capacity
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden load increases
- **Volume Testing**: Large amounts of data
- **Endurance Testing**: Extended periods

## API Performance Test Cases

### TC-PERF-001: API Response Time Under Normal Load
    - System is deployed in performance environment
    - No other load tests running
    - Monitoring tools are active
    1. Configure JMeter with 100 concurrent threads
    2. Start test execution
    3. Monitor response times
    4. Analyze results
    - 95th percentile < 200ms
    - 99th percentile < 500ms
    - No errors returned
    - System remains stable
    - Test results are saved
    - No memory leaks detected

### TC-PERF-002: Database Performance Under Load
    - Database is populated with test data
    - Performance monitoring enabled
    1. Execute concurrent database operations
    2. Monitor query execution times
    3. Check connection pool utilization
    4. Analyze slow query logs
    - Average query time < 100ms
    - No connection pool exhaustion
    - No deadlocks detected

## Load Testing Scenarios

### TC-PERF-003: Peak Load Simulation
    - Production-like environment
    - Full dataset loaded
    1. Gradually increase load to 1000 users
    2. Maintain peak load for 60 minutes
    3. Monitor all system metrics
    4. Verify auto-scaling behavior
    - System handles 1000 concurrent users
    - Auto-scaling triggers appropriately
    - Response times within SLA
    - No system failures

### TC-PERF-004: Stress Testing Beyond Capacity
    - System at baseline performance
    - Monitoring and alerting active
    1. Rapidly increase load beyond capacity
    2. Monitor system degradation
    3. Verify graceful degradation
    4. Test recovery after load reduction
    - System degrades gracefully
    - No data corruption
    - Quick recovery after load reduction
    - Appropriate error messages
