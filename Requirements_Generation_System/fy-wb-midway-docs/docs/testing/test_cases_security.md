# Security Test Cases

## Security Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
- **Authentication Testing**: Login, session management
- **Authorization Testing**: Access control, permissions
- **Input Validation Testing**: Injection attacks, XSS
- **Data Protection Testing**: Encryption, data leakage
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Network security, configuration

## Authentication Security Test Cases

### TC-SEC-001: SQL Injection Prevention
    - Application is deployed
    - Database is accessible
    1. Send malicious SQL in search parameter
    2. Monitor database for unauthorized queries
    3. Verify error handling
    4. Check application logs
    - Input is properly sanitized
    - No SQL injection occurs
    - Appropriate error message returned
    - Security event is logged

### TC-SEC-002: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
    - Web application is accessible
    - User input fields are available
    1. Submit XSS payload in input fields
    2. Verify output encoding
    3. Check for script execution
    4. Validate CSP headers
    - Script tags are encoded/stripped
    - No JavaScript execution
    - CSP headers prevent inline scripts

### TC-SEC-003: Authentication Bypass Testing
    - Protected endpoints are identified
    - Authentication is required
    1. Attempt access without authentication
    2. Try with invalid/expired tokens
    3. Test session fixation
    4. Verify access controls
    - All unauthorized access denied
    - Proper HTTP status codes (401/403)
    - Security events logged

## Data Protection Test Cases

### TC-SEC-004: Data Encryption Verification
    - Database contains sensitive data
    - Encryption is configured
    1. Query database directly
    2. Verify data is encrypted at rest
    3. Check encryption algorithms
    4. Validate key management
    - Sensitive data is encrypted
    - Strong encryption algorithms used
    - Keys are properly managed

### TC-SEC-005: PCI DSS Compliance Testing
    - Payment processing is implemented
    - PCI DSS requirements documented
    1. Verify card data encryption
    2. Check access logging
    3. Validate network segmentation
    4. Test vulnerability management
    - Card data is properly protected
    - Access is logged and monitored
    - Network is segmented
    - Vulnerabilities are managed

## Infrastructure Security Test Cases

### TC-SEC-006: Network Security Testing
    - Network infrastructure is deployed
    - Security groups are configured
    1. Scan for open ports
    2. Test firewall rules
    3. Verify SSL/TLS configuration
    4. Check for unnecessary services
    - Only required ports are open
    - Firewall rules are restrictive
    - Strong SSL/TLS configuration
    - No unnecessary services running
