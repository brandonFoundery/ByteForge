# Test Plan - FY.WB.Midway Enterprise Logistics Platform

## Overview

This is the master document for the FY.WB.Midway Enterprise Logistics Platform Test Plan. The complete testing strategy and test cases are organized into multiple linked documents for better maintainability and execution tracking.

## Test Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Verify all functional requirements are correctly implemented
- Validate non-functional requirements are met
- Ensure system reliability and stability under load
- Identify defects before production release
- Achieve comprehensive test coverage

### Quality Goals
- **Requirement Coverage**: 100% of critical and high-priority requirements
- **Code Coverage**: >80% for unit tests
- **Critical Defect Escape Rate**: 0%
- **Test Automation**: >70% of regression tests
- **Performance SLA**: Meet all NFR-PERF requirements

## Document Structure

The complete test plan is organized into the following documents:

### Test Strategy and Planning
- **[Test Strategy](./test_strategy.md)** - Overall testing approach, levels, and methodology

### Test Cases by Category
- **[Functional Test Cases](./test_cases_functional.md)** - Core business functionality testing
- **[Performance Test Cases](./test_cases_performance.md)** - Load, stress, and performance testing
- **[Security Test Cases](./test_cases_security.md)** - Security and compliance testing

### Test Automation
- **[Test Automation Framework](./test_automation.md)** - Automation strategy, tools, and scripts

## Test Scope

### In Scope
- **Customer Management**: Registration, profile management, KYC
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment transactions, PCI compliance
- **Load Management**: Booking, tracking, optimization
- **Invoice Processing**: Generation, reporting, financial operations
- **Carrier Management**: Registration, self-service portal
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, scalability
- **Integration**: API contracts, service communication

### Out of Scope
- Legacy system testing (except integration points)
- Third-party service internal testing
- Hardware compatibility testing
- Localization testing (Phase 2)

## Test Environment Strategy

### Environment Types
- **Development**: Developer testing and debugging
- **QA**: Functional and integration testing
- **Staging**: User acceptance and performance testing
- **Production**: Limited production validation

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
- **Payment Processing**: Financial transactions, PCI compliance
- **Data Security**: Customer PII, financial data protection
- **Integration Points**: External service dependencies
- **Performance**: High-load scenarios, scalability limits

## Success Criteria

### Release Readiness
- All critical and high-priority test cases passed
- No critical or high-severity defects open
- Performance SLAs met in staging environment
- Security testing completed with no critical findings
- User acceptance testing sign-off received
