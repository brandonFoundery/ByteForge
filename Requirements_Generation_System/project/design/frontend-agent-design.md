# Frontend Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Frontend Agent is responsible for developing and maintaining all user interface components and user experience flows. This includes creating responsive and accessible web pages, ensuring seamless integration with backend services, and optimizing performance for a smooth user experience.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
- Develop UI components using React and TypeScript.
- Implement styling using Tailwind CSS.
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.
- Collaborate with the Backend Agent for API integration.
- Conduct user testing and iterate based on feedback.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: For building reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Implement core UI components (header, footer, navigation).
- **Phase 2**: Develop user authentication flows (login, signup, password reset).
- **Phase 3**: Create dashboard and reporting interfaces.
- **Phase 4**: Implement real-time notifications and updates.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
Branches will follow the pattern `feature/frontend-*`, where `*` is a descriptive name of the feature being developed (e.g., `feature/frontend-login`).

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Create a Branch**: Start with `git checkout -b feature/frontend-*`.
2. **Develop**: Implement features and commit changes.
3. **Review**: Submit a pull request for code review.
4. **Merge**: After approval, merge into the main branch.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Organize components by feature in the `components` directory.
- **State Management**: Use React Context API for global state management.
- **Routing**: Utilize Next.js routing for page navigation.
- **API Integration**: Use Axios for HTTP requests to the backend.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **Backend Agent**: For data retrieval and storage.
- **API Gateway**: For secure API communication.
- **Authentication Service**: For user authentication and authorization.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Core UI Components
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Tasks**: Develop header, footer, and navigation components.

### Phase 2: User Authentication
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**: Implement login, signup, and password reset flows.

### Phase 3: Dashboard and Reporting
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Tasks**: Create user dashboard and reporting interfaces.

### Phase 4: Real-time Features
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**: Implement real-time notifications and updates.

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `components/`: Directory containing all UI components.
- `pages/`: Directory for Next.js pages.
- `styles/`: Directory for Tailwind CSS styles.

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
- Use `--add-dir components` to include UI components.
- Use `-p "Implement login flow using React and TypeScript"` for specific feature implementation.

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Ensure all components are responsive and accessible.
- Verify integration with backend services through API calls.
- Conduct user testing to validate user experience.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Performance**: Page load time under 2 seconds.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance.
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from user testing.
- **Code Quality**: Pass all code reviews and automated tests.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the Frontend Agent to implement features using Claude Code, ensuring a structured and efficient development process.
