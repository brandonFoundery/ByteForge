# Infrastructure Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Infrastructure Agent is tasked with managing and automating the cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment processes. It ensures that the infrastructure is scalable, reliable, and secure, leveraging Azure services, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
- Provisioning and managing Azure resources using Terraform.
- Setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.
- Containerizing applications using Docker and orchestrating them with Kubernetes.
- Automating deployment processes to ensure seamless integration and delivery.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Azure**: Cloud service provider for hosting and managing applications.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
- **Azure DevOps**: Platform for CI/CD pipeline management.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for application packaging.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for managing containerized applications.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Setup basic Azure infrastructure using Terraform.
- **Phase 2**: Implement CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.
- **Phase 3**: Containerize applications with Docker and deploy using Kubernetes.
- **Phase 4**: Automate deployment processes and integrate monitoring and security checks.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
Branches will follow the pattern `feature/infrastructure-*` to ensure consistency and traceability.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch Creation**: Create a branch from `main` using the naming convention.
2. **Development**: Implement features in the feature branch.
3. **Code Review**: Submit a pull request for code review.
4. **Testing**: Conduct automated and manual testing.
5. **Merge**: Merge the feature branch into `main` upon approval.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Azure Infrastructure**: Use Terraform to define and provision resources such as VMs, storage accounts, and networking components.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Use Azure DevOps to define build and release pipelines, integrating with Git repositories.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker to create container images and Kubernetes to manage deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **CI/CD Agent**: For pipeline integration and management.
- **Monitoring Agent**: For integrating monitoring solutions.
- **Security Agent**: For implementing security checks and compliance.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Azure Infrastructure Setup
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Tasks**: Define Terraform scripts, provision resources, validate setup.

### Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**: Setup Azure DevOps pipelines, integrate with repositories, automate build and deployment processes.

### Phase 3: Containerization and Deployment
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Tasks**: Containerize applications, configure Kubernetes clusters, deploy applications.

### Phase 4: Automation and Integration
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**: Automate deployment processes, integrate monitoring and security checks.

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `azure_infrastructure.tf`: Terraform scripts for Azure resources.
- `azure_devops_pipelines.yml`: YAML files for CI/CD pipelines.
- `dockerfiles/`: Directory containing Dockerfiles for applications.
- `kubernetes_manifests/`: Kubernetes deployment manifests.

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
- `--add-dir azure_infrastructure --add-dir azure_devops_pipelines --add-dir dockerfiles --add-dir kubernetes_manifests`
- `-p "Implement Azure infrastructure provisioning using Terraform scripts."`
- `-p "Setup CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps using provided YAML files."`
- `-p "Containerize applications using Docker and deploy using Kubernetes manifests."`

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Successful provisioning of Azure resources.
- CI/CD pipelines execute without errors.
- Applications are successfully containerized and deployed.
- Automated deployment processes function as expected.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Resources are provisioned within expected timeframes and configurations.
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: CI/CD pipelines reduce deployment time by 30%.
- **Deployment Success Rate**: 95% of deployments succeed without manual intervention.
- **Scalability**: Infrastructure can handle a 50% increase in load without performance degradation.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the Infrastructure Agent using Claude Code, ensuring a structured and efficient development process.
