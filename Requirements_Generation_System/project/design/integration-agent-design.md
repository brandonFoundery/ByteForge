# Integration Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Integration Agent is responsible for managing and executing third-party integrations, handling payment transactions via the Stripe API, and facilitating communication with external APIs through REST and Webhooks. It ensures seamless data flow between internal systems and external services, maintaining data integrity and security.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
- Implement and manage payment processing using Stripe API.
- Facilitate message exchange using Azure Service Bus.
- Develop and maintain REST API endpoints for external integrations.
- Handle incoming and outgoing Webhooks for real-time data synchronization.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Stripe API**: For payment processing and financial transactions.
- **Azure Service Bus**: For message queuing and service communication.
- **REST APIs**: For creating and consuming web services.
- **Webhooks**: For event-driven communication with external systems.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Implement Stripe API integration for payment processing.
- **Phase 2**: Develop REST API endpoints for third-party services.
- **Phase 3**: Set up Azure Service Bus for internal message handling.
- **Phase 4**: Configure Webhooks for real-time data updates.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
Branches will follow the pattern `feature/integration-*` where `*` is a descriptive name of the feature being developed, e.g., `feature/integration-stripe`.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch Creation**: Create a new branch from `main` using the naming convention.
2. **Development**: Implement features and commit changes regularly.
3. **Code Review**: Submit a pull request for peer review.
4. **Testing**: Conduct unit and integration testing.
5. **Merge**: Merge the feature branch into `main` after approval.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Stripe Integration**: Securely connect to Stripe API using OAuth for authentication. Implement endpoints for payment initiation, status checks, and refunds.
- **Azure Service Bus**: Set up queues and topics for asynchronous message processing. Implement handlers for message reception and processing.
- **REST APIs**: Design RESTful services with appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
- **Webhooks**: Implement listeners for incoming Webhooks and handlers for outgoing Webhook notifications.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **Payment Processing Agent**: For handling complex payment workflows.
- **Notification Agent**: For sending alerts and notifications.
- **User Management Agent**: For user authentication and authorization.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Stripe API Integration
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Tasks**: Set up Stripe account, implement payment endpoints, test transactions.

### Phase 2: REST API Development
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**: Design API schema, implement endpoints, document API.

### Phase 3: Azure Service Bus Setup
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Tasks**: Configure queues/topics, implement message handlers, test message flow.

### Phase 4: Webhook Configuration
- **Timeline**: 1 week
- **Tasks**: Set up Webhook listeners, implement handlers, test real-time updates.

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `stripe_config.json`: Configuration for Stripe API.
- `azure_service_bus_config.json`: Configuration for Azure Service Bus.
- `api_schema.yaml`: API schema definitions.

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
- **Stripe Integration**: `claude-code --add-dir stripe_integration -p "Implement Stripe payment processing endpoints"`
- **REST API Development**: `claude-code --add-dir rest_api -p "Develop REST API endpoints for third-party services"`
- **Azure Service Bus**: `claude-code --add-dir azure_service_bus -p "Set up Azure Service Bus for message handling"`
- **Webhooks**: `claude-code --add-dir webhooks -p "Configure Webhooks for real-time data synchronization"`

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Successful payment transactions via Stripe.
- Correct API responses and error handling.
- Reliable message processing through Azure Service Bus.
- Accurate real-time updates via Webhooks.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Payment Success Rate**: 99% of transactions processed successfully.
- **API Response Time**: Average response time under 200ms.
- **Message Delivery Rate**: 99.9% of messages delivered and processed.
- **Webhook Accuracy**: 100% accuracy in real-time data updates.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the Integration Agent's development, ensuring all features are implemented efficiently and effectively using Claude Code.
