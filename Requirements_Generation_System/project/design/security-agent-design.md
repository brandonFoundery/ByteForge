# Security Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Security Agent is responsible for ensuring secure access to the enterprise software system. It handles authentication, authorization, audit trails, and compliance with security standards. The agent will manage user identities, enforce access policies, and log security-related events.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
- Implement authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity and JWT.
- Integrate with Azure AD for single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.
- Manage secrets and sensitive data using Azure Key Vault.
- Maintain audit trails for all security-related events.
- Ensure compliance with industry security standards and regulations.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: For managing user identities and roles.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure token-based authentication.
- **Azure AD**: For SSO and identity federation.
- **Azure Key Vault**: For secure storage of keys and secrets.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Implement basic authentication and authorization.
- **Phase 2**: Integrate Azure AD for SSO.
- **Phase 3**: Set up audit trails and logging.
- **Phase 4**: Ensure compliance and conduct security reviews.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
Branches will follow the pattern `feature/security-*` to ensure consistency and traceability. Examples include `feature/security-auth`, `feature/security-azure-ad`.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch Creation**: Create a new branch from `main` for each feature.
2. **Development**: Implement features in the respective branch.
3. **Code Review**: Submit a pull request for peer review.
4. **Testing**: Conduct unit and integration testing.
5. **Merge**: Merge into `main` after successful testing and review.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Authentication**: Use ASP.NET Core Identity for user management and JWT for token issuance.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using ASP.NET Core policies.
- **Azure AD Integration**: Configure Azure AD for SSO and identity federation.
- **Key Management**: Use Azure Key Vault for storing and accessing secrets.
- **Audit Trails**: Log all security events using the Logging Agent.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **User Management Agent**: For user data and profile management.
- **Logging Agent**: For logging security events and audit trails.
- **Notification Agent**: For sending security alerts and notifications.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Basic Authentication and Authorization
- Timeline: 4 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Implement ASP.NET Core Identity.
  - Set up JWT for token-based authentication.
  - Develop RBAC policies.

### Phase 2: Azure AD Integration
- Timeline: 3 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Configure Azure AD for SSO.
  - Implement identity federation.

### Phase 3: Audit Trails and Logging
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Integrate with Logging Agent.
  - Develop audit trail logging.

### Phase 4: Compliance and Security Review
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Conduct security compliance checks.
  - Perform security reviews and audits.

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `auth_config.json`: Configuration for authentication settings.
- `azure_ad_config.json`: Azure AD integration settings.
- `key_vault_config.json`: Azure Key Vault settings.

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
- `--add-dir auth`: Add authentication module.
- `--add-dir azure-ad`: Integrate Azure AD.
- `--add-dir audit`: Implement audit trails.

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Ensure JWT tokens are correctly issued and validated.
- Verify Azure AD SSO functionality.
- Confirm audit logs are generated for all security events.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Authentication Success Rate**: 99% successful logins.
- **Authorization Accuracy**: 100% correct access control enforcement.
- **Audit Trail Completeness**: 100% of security events logged.
- **Compliance**: Pass all security compliance audits.
