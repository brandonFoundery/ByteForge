# UI Design Generation Task

You are an expert UI/UX designer tasked with creating a unique dashboard design for the FY.WB.Midway freight brokerage application.

## Reference Style Image: ui_style_1.png
I'm providing you with a reference style image that shows the aesthetic direction I want you to follow. Study this image carefully and create a design that captures its visual essence, color palette, typography choices, and overall design philosophy.

## Target Application: FY.WB.Midway Dashboard
This is a freight brokerage dashboard that needs to display:

### Key Data Points:
- Total Loads: 1,247 (â†‘12% from last month)
- Active Loads: 89 (â†‘8% from last month)
- Monthly Revenue: $285,750 (â†‘15% from last month)
- Load status indicators and recent activity

### Required Components:
1. **Header** with company name and user profile
2. **Welcome Section** with personalized greeting
3. **Stats Cards** showing the key metrics above with trend indicators
4. **Quick Actions Panel** with buttons for:
   - + New Load Entry
   - ðŸ“Š View Reports
   - ðŸ‘¥ Manage Carriers
5. **Recent Activity Feed** showing:
   - Load #12847 delivered successfully (2 hours ago)
   - New carrier application received (4 hours ago)
   - Invoice #INV-2024-0156 pending (6 hours ago)

## Design Requirements:

### Style Direction: Inspired by ui_style_1.png
- Interpret and expand on the visual style shown in the reference image
- Create your own unique take on this aesthetic
- Don't copy exactly - innovate within the style direction

### Technical Requirements:
- Use modern HTML5 and CSS3
- Implement with Tailwind CSS classes
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Include hover states and micro-interactions
- Use semantic HTML structure
- Ensure accessibility (proper contrast, ARIA labels)

### Creative Freedom:
- Choose your own color palette inspired by the reference
- Select appropriate typography (Google Fonts recommended)
- Design unique card layouts and spacing
- Create distinctive visual hierarchy
- Add your own creative elements (icons, illustrations, patterns)

## Output Format:
Provide a complete HTML file with embedded CSS that I can save and view directly in a browser. Include:

1. **Complete HTML structure** with all required components
2. **Embedded CSS** (either in <style> tags or inline Tailwind classes)
3. **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile
4. **Interactive elements** with hover effects
5. **Professional typography** and spacing
6. **Unique visual identity** inspired by but not copying the reference

## Important Notes:
- Make it genuinely unique - your interpretation of the style, not a copy
- Focus on user experience and visual hierarchy
- Ensure all data is clearly readable and actionable
- Create a design that feels modern and professional
- The reference image is inspiration, not a template to copy exactly

Generate a complete, production-ready HTML file that showcases your unique interpretation of this UI style for the FY.WB.Midway freight brokerage dashboard.
