- Platform integration and automation across all four systems

#### Impact Assessment
- **Documentation**: Created TRC-PRD.md with complete traceability requirements
- **Implementation**: Establishes scope for traceability system development
- **Testing**: Defines verification methods for each traceability requirement
- **Timeline**: No impact to existing logistics platform timeline - parallel initiative
- **Resources**: Requires dedicated traceability team allocation

#### After
Complete RTM with 42 requirements mapped across four systems:
1. **Customer Payment Processing** (5 requirements): REQ-PAY-001 to REQ-PAY-005
2. **Load Booking Management** (5 requirements): REQ-LOAD-001 to REQ-LOAD-005
3. **Invoice Processing** (5 requirements): REQ-INV-001 to REQ-INV-005
4. **Notchify Carrier Payment** (5 requirements): REQ-CARR-001 to REQ-CARR-005
5. **Cross-System Integration** (3 requirements): REQ-INT-001 to REQ-INT-003
6. **Security and Compliance** (2 requirements): REQ-SEC-001, REQ-COMP-001, REQ-COMP-002

9. **Communication and Reporting** (4 requirements): REQ-COMM-001, REQ-RPT-001, REQ-RPT-002, REQ-BI-001

Each requirement includes:
- System scope identification
- Cross-system dependencies
- Business value assessment
- Risk level evaluation
- Owner assignment

#### Impact Assessment
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive RTM.csv with all platform requirements
- **Implementation**: Clear requirement inventory for traceability system development
- **Testing**: Verification methods defined for each platform requirement
- **Timeline**: No impact - baseline establishment for existing requirements
- **Resources**: Platform teams have clear requirement assignments in traceability system

#### Approval Chain
- [x] Business Analyst Review - Completed 2024-01-15
- [x] Platform Technical Lead Review - Completed 2024-01-15
- [x] System Team Leads Review - Completed 2024-01-15

### Change ID: CHG-2024-01-15-003
- **Date**: 2024-01-15 13:00:00
- **Type**: Addition
- **Affected Requirements**: Cross-system integration requirements (REQ-INT-001, REQ-INT-002, REQ-INT-003)
- **Requestor**: Integration Architect
- **Approver**: Platform Technical Lead
- **Reason**: Define critical cross-system integration requirements for traceability tracking
- **Impact Analysis**: Establishes foundation for managing complex system interdependencies
- **Implementation Effort**: 24 hours for integration requirement analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: High - integration requirements are critical for platform success

#### Description
Addition of specific cross-system integration requirements to ensure the traceability system properly tracks the complex interdependencies between the four logistics systems.

#### Before
Individual system requirements existed but cross-system integration requirements were not explicitly defined for traceability.

#### After
Three critical integration requirements added:
1. **REQ-INT-001**: Real-time Data Synchronization across all systems
2. **REQ-INT-002**: Event-Driven Architecture for system communication
3. **REQ-INT-003**: End-to-End Workflow Automation across systems

These requirements have high business value and high risk levels due to their critical nature for platform integration success.

#### Impact Assessment
- **Documentation**: Enhanced RTM with critical integration requirements
- **Implementation**: Clear integration tracking for development teams
- **Testing**: Integration testing requirements defined
- **Timeline**: No impact - requirements definition for existing integration work
- **Resources**: Integration team has clear requirements for traceability tracking
