# Frontend Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Frontend Agent is responsible for developing and maintaining all user interface components and ensuring a seamless user experience. This includes implementing responsive designs, managing state, and integrating with backend services.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
- Develop UI components using React and TypeScript.
- Style components with Tailwind CSS.
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness across devices.
- Integrate with backend APIs for data fetching and state management.
- Implement user experience flows as per design specifications.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Library**: React
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Implement core UI components (header, footer, navigation).
- **Phase 2**: Develop user authentication flows (login, signup, password reset).
- **Phase 3**: Create dashboard and data visualization components.
- **Phase 4**: Implement settings and profile management features.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
Branches will follow the pattern `feature/frontend-*`, where `*` is a descriptive name of the feature being developed (e.g., `feature/frontend-authentication`).

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Create Branch**: Start by creating a new branch from `main` using the naming convention.
2. **Development**: Implement features and commit changes regularly.
3. **Code Review**: Open a pull request for peer review.
4. **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass before merging.
5. **Merge**: Merge the feature branch into `main` after approval.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Organize components by feature within the `components` directory.
- **State Management**: Use React Context API for global state management.
- **Routing**: Utilize Next.js routing for page navigation.
- **API Integration**: Use `fetch` or `axios` for API calls, handling responses and errors appropriately.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **Backend Agent**: For data fetching and state synchronization.
- **API Gateway**: For secure and efficient API communication.
- **Authentication Service**: For managing user sessions and authentication flows.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Core UI Components
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Tasks**: Develop header, footer, and navigation components.

### Phase 2: User Authentication
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**: Implement login, signup, and password reset flows.

### Phase 3: Dashboard and Visualization
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Tasks**: Create dashboard layout and integrate data visualization libraries.

### Phase 4: Settings and Profile Management
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Tasks**: Develop settings page and profile management features.

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `components/`: Directory containing all UI components.
- `pages/`: Directory for Next.js pages.
- `styles/`: Tailwind CSS configuration and global styles.

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
- Use `--add-dir components` to specify the components directory.
- Use `-p "Implement responsive navigation bar using Tailwind CSS"` for specific tasks.

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Ensure all components are responsive and accessible.
- Verify integration with backend services through API calls.
- Confirm that user flows match design specifications.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Performance**: Page load time under 2 seconds.
- **Accessibility**: Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **User Testing**: Conduct usability tests with at least 10 users.
- **Automated Testing**: Achieve 90% test coverage with unit and integration tests.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the Frontend Agent to implement features using Claude Code, ensuring a robust and user-friendly interface.
