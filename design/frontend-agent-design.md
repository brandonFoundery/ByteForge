# Frontend Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Frontend Agent is responsible for developing and maintaining all user-facing components, interfaces, and experience flows in the enterprise software application. This includes creating responsive, accessible, and performant UI elements that integrate seamlessly with backend services. The agent ensures a consistent user experience across devices, handles client-side state management, and implements interactive features using modern web technologies. Key responsibilities include:
- Designing and implementing UI components based on wireframes and requirements.
- Managing routing, navigation, and user flows.
- Integrating with APIs provided by other agents (e.g., Backend Agent).
- Ensuring accessibility (WCAG compliance), responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility.
- Optimizing for performance, including lazy loading and code splitting.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
The scope encompasses all frontend development tasks, from initial project setup to feature implementation and iterative improvements. This includes:
- Setting up the Next.js project structure.
- Developing reusable React components.
- Styling with Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent design.
- Implementing TypeScript for type-safe code.
- Handling user authentication flows, dashboards, forms, and data visualization.
- Excluding backend logic, database interactions, or server-side rendering configurations that depend on other agents (e.g., API endpoints from Backend Agent).

Out of scope: Server-side logic, data persistence, or non-UI related tasks, which are handled by dependent agents.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes (if needed for frontend-specific endpoints).
- **React**: Core library for building user interfaces with hooks and component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing, improving code quality and developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling, enabling rapid prototyping and consistent theming.
Additional tools: ESLint for linting, Prettier for formatting, React Query or SWR for data fetching, and Zustand or Redux for state management if complex global state is required.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
Based on the development plan (dev_plan.md), features are organized by phase for a task management enterprise application. Only frontend-specific features are assigned to this agent. Phases include setup, core functionality, enhancements, and deployment preparation.

- **Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication (Foundation)**
  - Set up Next.js project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  - Implement login and registration pages with form validation.
  - Create protected routes and authentication guards.

- **Phase 2: Core User Flows (MVP Development)**
  - Develop dashboard component displaying user tasks and summaries.
  - Implement task creation, editing, and deletion forms.
  - Build task list view with filtering, sorting, and pagination.

- **Phase 3: Advanced Features and UX Enhancements**
  - Add real-time notifications and updates (integrating with Backend Agent's WebSocket).
  - Implement user profile management page.
  - Develop responsive navigation menu and sidebar.

- **Phase 4: Optimization and Testing**
  - Optimize performance with code splitting and image optimization.
  - Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
  - Create error handling and loading states for all components.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
All branches must follow the pattern `feature/frontend-*`, where `*` is a descriptive slug (e.g., `feature/frontend-login-page`, `feature/frontend-dashboard`). Bug fixes use `fix/frontend-*`, and hotfixes use `hotfix/frontend-*`. Branches are created from the `main` branch and merged via pull requests.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch from `main` using the naming convention.
2. **Development**: Implement features in isolation, committing frequently with descriptive messages (e.g., "feat: add login form component").
3. **Testing**: Run local tests (unit, integration) and manual UI checks.
4. **Pull Request (PR)**: Open a PR to `main` with a description linking to requirements, screenshots of UI changes, and any integration notes.
5. **Review and Merge**: Await reviews from other agents (e.g., Backend Agent for API compatibility). Merge after approval and CI/CD passes.
6. **Deployment**: Post-merge, trigger automated deployment to staging for verification.
Use Git Flow principles, with semantic versioning for releases.

## 4. Technical Architecture
The frontend architecture follows a modular Next.js structure for scalability:

- **Project Structure**:
  - `/app`: Next.js app router for pages and layouts (e.g., `/app/layout.tsx` for root layout, `/app/page.tsx` for home).
  - `/components`: Reusable React components (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`), organized by feature (e.g., `/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`).
  - `/lib`: Utility functions, API clients (e.g., Axios instance for Backend Agent APIs), and hooks.
  - `/styles`: Global Tailwind CSS configurations and custom themes.
  - `/public`: Static assets like images and fonts.
  - `/types`: TypeScript type definitions (e.g., for API responses).

- **Key Patterns**:
  - **Component Hierarchy**: Use atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms) for reusability. E.g., Atom: Button; Molecule: FormInput; Organism: TaskForm.
  - **State Management**: Local state with React hooks; global state with Zustand for auth and user data.
  - **Data Fetching**: Server components for initial data loads; Client-side fetching with React Query for dynamic updates.
  - **Styling**: Tailwind classes for inline styling; Custom themes in `tailwind.config.js` for branding.
  - **Routing**: Next.js App Router with dynamic routes (e.g., `/tasks/[id]`).
  - **Error Handling**: Custom error boundaries and global error pages.
  - **Performance**: Use Next.js features like `Suspense` for loading states and `Image` component for optimization.

TypeScript is enforced project-wide for props, state, and API interfaces to prevent runtime errors.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **Agent Dependencies**:
  - **Backend Agent**: Provides RESTful APIs (e.g., `/api/tasks`) for data fetching. Integration via API client in `/lib/api.ts`.
  - **Auth Agent**: Supplies authentication tokens and endpoints (e.g., JWT handling). Frontend integrates via protected routes and interceptors.
  - **Database Agent**: Indirect dependency through Backend; ensures data models match TypeScript types.

- **External Services**:
  - Authentication: Integrate with services like Auth0 if specified.
  - Analytics: Google Analytics or similar for tracking user interactions.
  - Integration Points: API calls are made via fetch or Axios, with error handling for 4xx/5xx responses. WebSockets for real-time features (Phase 3).

All integrations are mocked during development for isolation.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase
The plan aligns with the development phases, with estimated timelines assuming a 12-week sprint cycle.

- **Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication (Weeks 1-2)**
  - Week 1: Initialize Next.js project, configure Tailwind and TypeScript, set up root layout and basic routing.
