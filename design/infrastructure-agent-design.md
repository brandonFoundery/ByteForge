# Infrastructure Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Infrastructure Agent is responsible for managing and automating the cloud infrastructure, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and deployment processes for the enterprise software system. This agent ensures that all infrastructure components are provisioned, configured, and maintained in a scalable, secure, and efficient manner. Key responsibilities include:
- Provisioning and managing Azure cloud resources using Terraform for infrastructure-as-code (IaC).
- Setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- Containerizing applications using Docker and orchestrating them with Kubernetes for scalable deployments.
- Monitoring infrastructure health, scaling resources as needed, and ensuring high availability.
- Integrating with other agents (e.g., Security Agent for compliance checks, Database Agent for persistent storage setup) to provide a cohesive infrastructure foundation.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
The scope includes all infrastructure-related tasks from initial setup to ongoing maintenance. This encompasses:
- Cloud resource provisioning (e.g., VMs, networks, storage in Azure).
- Automation of deployment pipelines (build, test, deploy).
- Containerization and orchestration for microservices.
- Integration with monitoring tools and logging.
- Handling infrastructure updates, rollbacks, and disaster recovery.
Out of scope: Application-level code development (handled by Backend/Frontend Agents), data modeling (Database Agent), and security policies (Security Agent).

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Cloud Platform**: Azure (core services like Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Storage Accounts).
- **IaC Tool**: Terraform (for declarative resource management).
- **CI/CD Tool**: Azure DevOps (pipelines, repositories, artifacts).
- **Containerization**: Docker (for building and packaging applications).
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (via AKS for managing containerized workloads).
- **Supporting Tools**: Azure CLI, Helm (for Kubernetes package management), Git for version control.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
Based on the development plan (dev_plan.md), the Infrastructure Agent is assigned features related to infrastructure setup, automation, and deployment. These are organized by phase for phased implementation. (Note: Features are extracted and adapted from dev_plan.md; assuming a multi-phase plan with Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Automation, Phase 3: Optimization, Phase 4: Maintenance.)

- **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
  - INFRA-001: Provision core Azure resources (e.g., Resource Group, VNet, Subnets) using Terraform.
  - INFRA-002: Set up Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster for container orchestration.
  - INFRA-003: Configure Docker for application containerization.

- **Phase 2: CI/CD Automation**
  - INFRA-004: Implement Azure DevOps pipelines for CI (build and test).
  - INFRA-005: Set up CD pipelines for automated deployments to AKS.
  - INFRA-006: Integrate Docker builds into Azure DevOps.

- **Phase 3: Scaling and Optimization**
  - INFRA-007: Implement auto-scaling rules in AKS using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
  - INFRA-008: Set up monitoring with Azure Monitor and integrate with Terraform.
  - INFRA-009: Optimize resource costs with Terraform modules for spot instances.

- **Phase 4: Maintenance and Integration**
  - INFRA-010: Create rollback and disaster recovery scripts in Terraform.
  - INFRA-011: Integrate with Security Agent for infrastructure scanning.
  - INFRA-012: Automate infrastructure updates via Azure DevOps release pipelines.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
All branches for this agent follow the pattern `feature/infrastructure-*`, where `*` is a descriptive slug (e.g., `feature/infrastructure-aks-setup`, `feature/infrastructure-cicd-pipeline`). Bug fixes use `bugfix/infrastructure-*`, and releases use `release/infrastructure-vX.Y.Z`. Branches must be created from the `main` branch and merged via pull requests (PRs) with approvals.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch from `main` using the naming convention.
2. **Development**: Implement features using Terraform scripts, Azure DevOps YAML pipelines, Dockerfiles, and Kubernetes manifests. Commit changes with descriptive messages (e.g., "INFRA-001: Add Terraform module for Azure VNet").
3. **Testing**: Run local tests (e.g., `terraform validate`, Docker builds, kubectl apply in a dev cluster).
4. **Pull Request**: Submit a PR to `main` with code reviews from at least two team members. Include automated checks (e.g., Terraform linting via Azure DevOps).
5. **Merge and Deploy**: After approval, merge and trigger a deployment pipeline to apply changes to staging/production environments.
6. **Cleanup**: Delete the feature branch post-merge.

## 4. Technical Architecture
The architecture is modular, leveraging IaC for reproducibility. Key components:
- **Terraform Layer**: Modular structure with root module calling child modules (e.g., `modules/aks`, `modules/network`). State stored in Azure Blob Storage with locking via Azure Table Storage.
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines**: YAML-based pipelines in `azure-pipelines.yml`. Multi-stage pipelines: build (Docker image creation), test (unit/integration), deploy (Helm charts to AKS).
- **Docker and Kubernetes**: Applications containerized into Docker images pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR). Kubernetes manifests define Deployments, Services, and Ingress. AKS cluster with managed identities for secure access.
- **Integration Flow**: Terraform provisions base infra → Azure DevOps builds/pushes Docker images → Kubernetes deploys via Helm in CD stage.
- **High-Level Diagram** (text-based):
  ```
  [Azure DevOps Repo] --> [CI Pipeline: Build Docker] --> [ACR]
  [Terraform Scripts] --> [Azure Resources: AKS, VNet]
  [CD Pipeline] --> [Helm Deploy to AKS] --> [Kubernetes Pods]
  [Monitoring: Azure Monitor] <-- [AKS Cluster]
  ```

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **Agent Dependencies**:
  - Security Agent: For integrating vulnerability scanning in CI/CD and Terraform security modules.
  - Database Agent: For provisioning Azure SQL/Database resources via Terraform and connecting to AKS.
  - Backend Agent: For deploying backend services as Docker containers in Kubernetes.
- **External Services**:
  - Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication in AKS and DevOps.
  - Azure Container Registry (ACR) for image storage.
  - External tools: GitHub (if mirroring repos), Prometheus/Grafana for advanced monitoring.
- **Integration Points**:
  - API calls from Terraform to Azure APIs for resource creation.
  - Webhooks in Azure DevOps for triggering pipelines on PR merges.
  - Kubernetes secrets pulled from Azure Key Vault (integrated via Security Agent).

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `dev_plan.md`: Development plan for feature extraction.
- `requirements.md`: High-level requirements.
- Directory: `infra/terraform/` (for Terraform modules).
- Directory: `infra/pipelines/` (for Azure DevOps YAML files).
- Directory: `infra/kubernetes/` (for manifests and Helm charts).
- Directory: `infra/docker/` (for Dockerfiles).

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
Use Claude Code with `--add-dir` to include directories and `-p` for prompts. Examples:
- For INFRA-001: `claude code --add-dir infra/terraform/ -p 'Implement a Terraform module to provision an Azure Resource Group and VNet. Use variables for region and naming. Ensure idempotency and output resource IDs.'`
- For INFRA-004: `claude code --add-dir infra/pipelines/ -p 'Create an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline for CI that builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile, runs tests, and pushes to ACR. Include triggers for main branch.'`
- For INFRA-007: `claude code --add-dir infra/kubernetes/ -p 'Generate a Kubernetes YAML for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler in AKS, targeting a Deployment with CPU utilization threshold of 50%. Integrate with existing manifests.'`
- General: `claude code --add-dir infra/ -p 'Refactor Terraform code for modularity, adding a new module for AKS auto-scaling based on the development plan.'`

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Code must pass linters (e.g., `terraform fmt`, YAML lint).
- Successful dry-run: `terraform plan` with no unexpected changes; Docker build without errors; `kubectl apply --dry-run`.
- Integration tests: Pipeline runs end-to-end without failures; resources provisioned match expected state.
- Security: No hard-coded secrets; use managed identities.
- Documentation: Each file includes comments explaining purpose and usage.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Success Metrics**:
  - 100% uptime for AKS cluster post-deployment.
  - CI/CD pipeline completion time < 5 minutes.
