# Infrastructure Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Infrastructure Agent is responsible for managing and automating cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment processes. It ensures that the infrastructure is scalable, reliable, and secure, leveraging modern DevOps practices.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
- Provisioning and managing cloud resources on Azure.
- Automating infrastructure deployment using Terraform.
- Setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.
- Containerizing applications using Docker and orchestrating them with Kubernetes.
- Ensuring compliance with security and operational standards.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Azure**: For cloud infrastructure and services.
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure as code.
- **Azure DevOps**: For CI/CD pipelines.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Set up Azure infrastructure and basic CI/CD pipelines.
- **Phase 2**: Implement Terraform scripts for infrastructure automation.
- **Phase 3**: Integrate Docker and Kubernetes for application deployment.
- **Phase 4**: Enhance security and monitoring capabilities.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
Branches will follow the pattern `feature/infrastructure-*` to ensure consistency and traceability.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch Creation**: Create a branch from `main` using the naming convention.
2. **Development**: Implement features in the feature branch.
3. **Code Review**: Submit a pull request for peer review.
4. **Testing**: Conduct unit and integration tests.
5. **Merge**: Merge into `main` after successful review and testing.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Azure Resource Groups**: Organize resources for different environments (dev, test, prod).
- **Terraform Modules**: Modularize infrastructure components for reusability.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes using Azure DevOps.
- **Docker Containers**: Standardize application environments.
- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Manage containerized applications at scale.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **Deployment Agent**: For application deployment coordination.
- **Monitoring Agent**: For infrastructure and application monitoring.
- **Security Agent**: For implementing security policies and compliance checks.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Azure Setup and CI/CD
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up Azure resource groups and networks.
  - Create initial CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.

### Phase 2: Terraform Automation
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning.
  - Test and validate infrastructure deployments.

### Phase 3: Docker and Kubernetes Integration
- **Timeline**: 5 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Containerize applications using Docker.
  - Deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters.

### Phase 4: Security and Monitoring
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate security checks into CI/CD pipelines.
  - Set up monitoring dashboards and alerts.

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `azure_config.yaml`: Configuration for Azure resources.
- `terraform_scripts/`: Directory containing Terraform scripts.
- `dockerfiles/`: Directory containing Dockerfiles for applications.
- `k8s_manifests/`: Kubernetes deployment manifests.

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
- **Azure Setup**: `claude-code --add-dir azure_config.yaml -p "Set up Azure infrastructure as per configuration."`
- **Terraform Deployment**: `claude-code --add-dir terraform_scripts -p "Deploy infrastructure using Terraform scripts."`
- **Docker and Kubernetes**: `claude-code --add-dir dockerfiles --add-dir k8s_manifests -p "Containerize and deploy applications to Kubernetes."`

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Successful deployment of infrastructure and applications.
- CI/CD pipelines execute without errors.
- Security and monitoring tools are operational.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Deployment Success Rate**: 95% of deployments succeed without manual intervention.
- **Pipeline Execution Time**: CI/CD pipelines complete within 15 minutes.
- **Security Compliance**: 100% compliance with security policies.
- **Monitoring Coverage**: 100% of critical infrastructure components are monitored.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the Infrastructure Agent using Claude Code, ensuring a robust and automated infrastructure management process.
