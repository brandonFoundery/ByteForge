# Integration Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Integration Agent is responsible for managing and facilitating seamless interactions between our system and third-party services. This includes handling payment processing through Stripe, managing message queues via Azure Service Bus, and integrating with various external REST APIs and Webhooks.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
- Implement and maintain integrations with Stripe for payment processing.
- Utilize Azure Service Bus for reliable message queuing and processing.
- Develop REST API endpoints for external service interactions.
- Configure and manage Webhooks for real-time data synchronization.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Stripe API**: For handling all payment-related functionalities.
- **Azure Service Bus**: For message queuing and asynchronous processing.
- **REST APIs**: For communication with external services.
- **Webhooks**: For event-driven interactions and real-time updates.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Implement Stripe payment integration.
- **Phase 2**: Set up Azure Service Bus for message handling.
- **Phase 3**: Develop REST API endpoints for third-party services.
- **Phase 4**: Configure Webhooks for real-time data updates.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
All branches related to this agent will follow the pattern `feature/integration-*`, where `*` represents the specific feature or task being developed.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch Creation**: Create a branch from `develop` using the naming convention.
2. **Development**: Implement the feature, ensuring adherence to coding standards.
3. **Code Review**: Submit a pull request for peer review.
4. **Testing**: Conduct unit and integration testing.
5. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the feature branch back into `develop`.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Stripe Integration**: Utilize Stripe's SDK for secure payment processing. Implement webhooks to handle payment events.
- **Azure Service Bus**: Set up topics and subscriptions for message distribution. Implement message handlers for processing.
- **REST APIs**: Design RESTful endpoints following best practices for scalability and security.
- **Webhooks**: Configure endpoints to receive and process webhook events from third-party services.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **Payment Processing Agent**: For handling complex payment workflows.
- **Notification Agent**: To send notifications based on integration events.
- **User Management Agent**: For user authentication and authorization.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Stripe Integration
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Tasks**: Implement payment processing, configure webhooks, test payment flows.

### Phase 2: Azure Service Bus Setup
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks
- **Tasks**: Set up service bus, implement message handlers, test message processing.

### Phase 3: REST API Development
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Tasks**: Design and implement API endpoints, ensure security measures, conduct API testing.

### Phase 4: Webhook Configuration
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Tasks**: Configure webhook endpoints, implement event processing logic, test real-time updates.

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `stripe_integration.md`
- `azure_service_bus_setup.md`
- `rest_api_design.md`
- `webhook_configuration.md`

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
- `--add-dir stripe_integration.md -p "Implement Stripe payment processing and webhook handling."`
- `--add-dir azure_service_bus_setup.md -p "Set up Azure Service Bus for message queuing."`
- `--add-dir rest_api_design.md -p "Develop REST API endpoints for external service integration."`
- `--add-dir webhook_configuration.md -p "Configure and test webhook endpoints for real-time updates."`

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Successful payment transactions via Stripe.
- Reliable message processing through Azure Service Bus.
- Secure and functional REST API endpoints.
- Real-time data synchronization via Webhooks.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Payment Success Rate**: 99% of transactions processed successfully.
- **Message Processing Latency**: Average processing time under 200ms.
- **API Response Time**: Average response time under 100ms.
- **Webhook Event Handling**: 95% of events processed within 1 second.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the development and implementation of the Integration Agent, ensuring alignment with enterprise standards and readiness for Claude Code execution.
