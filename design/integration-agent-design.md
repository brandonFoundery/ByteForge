# Integration Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Integration Agent is a specialized AI agent responsible for handling all third-party integrations within the enterprise software system. Its primary role is to facilitate seamless communication between the core application and external services, ensuring data synchronization, event handling, and secure transactions. Key responsibilities include:
- Integrating with payment gateways like Stripe for processing payments, subscriptions, and refunds.
- Managing message queuing and event-driven architectures using Azure Service Bus for reliable asynchronous communication.
- Implementing REST APIs and webhooks for real-time data exchange with external systems.
- Handling error recovery, retries, and logging for integration failures to maintain system reliability.
- Ensuring compliance with security standards (e.g., PCI DSS for payments) and data privacy regulations.

This agent acts as a bridge, abstracting the complexities of external APIs from the core business logic, allowing other agents to focus on their domains.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
The scope includes developing features related to external integrations, such as payment processing, notification systems, and API gateways. It excludes core business logic, UI/UX, and database schema design, which are handled by other agents. The agent will implement modular components that can be plugged into the main application, with a focus on scalability to handle high-volume transactions (e.g., 10,000+ payments per day).

Out-of-scope: Direct user authentication (handled by Authentication Agent) and data persistence (handled by Database Agent).

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Stripe API**: For payment processing, including charges, subscriptions, and webhooks for events like payment success/failure.
- **Azure Service Bus**: For message queuing, topics, and subscriptions to handle asynchronous events (e.g., order confirmations).
- **REST APIs**: Custom endpoints for integrating with third-party services, built using frameworks like Express.js or ASP.NET.
- **Webhooks**: Secure endpoints to receive real-time updates from external services, with signature verification for security.
- Supporting Tools: Node.js/Python for backend logic, Axios/Requests for API calls, and logging libraries like Winston or Serilog.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
Based on the development plan (dev_plan.md), the Integration Agent is assigned features related to third-party integrations, organized by phase. These features focus on building robust, scalable integration points. (Note: Features are extracted and adapted from the plan's milestones for payments, messaging, and API integrations.)

### Phase 1: Foundation and Setup (Weeks 1-2)
- Implement basic Stripe integration for one-time payments.
- Set up Azure Service Bus queue for internal event handling.
- Develop a generic REST API wrapper for external service calls.

### Phase 2: Core Integrations (Weeks 3-5)
- Add Stripe subscription management and webhook handling for payment events.
- Integrate Azure Service Bus with topics/subscriptions for multi-consumer events (e.g., order processing).
- Create webhook endpoints for receiving updates from third-party CRM systems.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Optimization (Weeks 6-8)
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for failed integrations.
- Add support for additional payment gateways (e.g., fallback to PayPal via REST APIs).
- Optimize for high-throughput: Implement batch processing in Azure Service Bus and rate limiting for APIs.

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Weeks 9-10)
- Develop integration tests for all features.
- Set up monitoring and alerting for integration failures.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
All development work for this agent must follow the branch pattern `feature/integration-*`, where `*` is a descriptive slug (e.g., `feature/integration-stripe-payments`). Bug fixes use `fix/integration-*`, and releases use `release/integration-vX.Y.Z`. Branches should be short-lived and merged into `main` via pull requests.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch from `main` for each feature or bug fix.
2. **Development**: Implement code in isolation, adhering to the agent's technology stack. Use Claude Code for code generation.
3. **Testing**: Run unit/integration tests locally. Commit with descriptive messages.
4. **Pull Request (PR)**: Submit PR with code reviews from at least two team members. Include test coverage reports.
5. **Merge and Deploy**: Merge approved PRs. Trigger CI/CD pipelines for deployment to staging/production.
6. **Conflict Resolution**: Rebase branches regularly to avoid merge conflicts.

Workflow Tools: GitHub Actions for CI/CD, with automated linting and testing.

## 4. Technical Architecture
The Integration Agent's architecture is event-driven and modular, designed for scalability and fault tolerance.

- **High-Level Components**:
  - **Payment Module**: Interfaces with Stripe API for CRUD operations on payments/subscriptions. Uses webhooks to listen for events and trigger internal actions (e.g., update order status via Azure Service Bus).
  - **Messaging Module**: Azure Service Bus as the backbone for queuing messages. Producers (e.g., Core Agent) send messages to queues/topics; consumers process them asynchronously.
  - **API Gateway Module**: Exposes REST APIs for external integrations and handles incoming webhooks with authentication (e.g., HMAC signatures).
  - **Error Handling Layer**: Centralized retry logic using exponential backoff, dead-letter queues in Azure Service Bus, and logging to a central system.

- **Data Flow**:
  1. External event (e.g., Stripe webhook) → Webhook Endpoint → Validation → Enqueue to Azure Service Bus.
  2. Internal producer (e.g., from Database Agent) → REST API Call → Process and Respond.
  3. Consumer processes queue → Interact with dependencies (e.g., update database via Database Agent).

- **Scalability Considerations**: Use Azure's auto-scaling for Service Bus, containerization with Docker/Kubernetes for API endpoints, and caching (e.g., Redis) for frequent API calls.

- **Security**: API keys stored in environment variables or Azure Key Vault. All webhooks require signature verification. Encrypt sensitive data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.

```
[External Service (Stripe)] --> Webhook --> [Webhook Handler] --> [Azure Service Bus Queue] --> [Consumer Processor] --> [Dependencies (e.g., Database Agent)]
[Internal Agent] --> REST API --> [API Gateway] --> [Payment Module] --> [Stripe API]
```

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **Internal Dependencies**:
  - **Core Agent**: Provides business events (e.g., "initiate payment") that trigger integrations.
  - **Database Agent**: For storing integration metadata (e.g., payment IDs, webhook logs). Integration via internal APIs or shared queues.
  - **Authentication Agent**: For securing API endpoints and handling OAuth tokens for external services.

- **External Dependencies**:
  - Stripe API: For payments (requires API keys).
  - Azure Service Bus: For messaging (requires connection strings).
  - Third-party REST APIs/Webhooks: Configurable via environment variables.

Integration Points: Use Azure Service Bus for loose coupling. All interactions are asynchronous where possible to avoid blocking.

- For Azure Service Bus: `claude-code --add-dir src/integration/messaging -p "Set up Azure Service Bus client in Python. Implement producer and consumer for payment events. Handle dead-letter queues and exponential backoff retries."`

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Code must pass linting (ESLint/Pylint) and unit tests (Jest/Pytest).
- Features should handle edge cases (e.g., network failures, invalid webhooks).
- Validate with mock services (e.g., Stripe sandbox, Azure emulator).
- Ensure no hard-coded secrets; use config files.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Success Metrics**:
  - 99.9% uptime for integration endpoints.
  - <1% failure rate for payment processing.
  - Average latency <300ms for API calls; throughput >500 messages/minute for Service Bus.
  - 100% coverage of security checks (e.g., all webhooks verified).

- **Testing Criteria**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions (e.g., charge creation, message enqueueing).
  - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end flows (e.g., simulate Stripe webhook → Service Bus → Database update). Use tools like Postman for API testing and Azure SDK mocks.
  - **Load Tests**: Simulate 1,000 concurrent payments using JMeter.
  - **Security Tests**: Penetration testing for webhook vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP ZAP).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: All features must pass in staging environment before production deployment. Monitor with Azure Application Insights for real-time metrics.
