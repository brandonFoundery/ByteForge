# Security Agent Design Document

## 1. Agent Overview

### 1.1 Role and Responsibilities
The Security Agent is responsible for managing authentication, authorization, audit trails, and ensuring compliance with security standards. It will handle user identity management, secure access to resources, and maintain logs for auditing purposes.

### 1.2 Scope of Work
- Implement authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity and JWT.
- Integrate with Azure AD for enterprise-level identity management.
- Secure sensitive data using Azure Key Vault.
- Maintain audit trails for all security-related events.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: For managing user identities and roles.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure token-based authentication.
- **Azure AD**: For enterprise identity and access management.
- **Azure Key Vault**: For managing secrets and keys securely.

## 2. Feature Assignments from Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Implement basic authentication and authorization.
- **Phase 2**: Integrate Azure AD for SSO and enterprise identity management.
- **Phase 3**: Implement audit trails and logging.
- **Phase 4**: Ensure compliance with security standards.

## 3. Branch Strategy and Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Naming Convention
- Use the pattern `feature/security-*` for all branches related to security features.

### 3.2 Development Workflow
1. Create a new branch from `develop` using the naming convention.
2. Implement the feature in the branch.
3. Conduct code reviews and testing.
4. Merge the branch back into `develop` after approval.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Authentication**: Use ASP.NET Core Identity for user management and JWT for token-based authentication.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using ASP.NET Core Identity.
- **Integration with Azure AD**: Use OpenID Connect for SSO and manage enterprise identities.
- **Data Security**: Store sensitive information in Azure Key Vault and access it securely.
- **Audit Trails**: Use a centralized logging system to record all security events.

## 5. Dependencies and Integration Points
- **User Management Agent**: For managing user profiles and roles.
- **Logging Agent**: For recording audit trails and security events.
- **Notification Agent**: For sending security alerts and notifications.

## 6. Implementation Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Basic Authentication and Authorization
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Set up ASP.NET Core Identity.
  - Implement JWT authentication.
  - Create basic RBAC.

### Phase 2: Azure AD Integration
- Timeline: 3 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Configure Azure AD for SSO.
  - Implement OpenID Connect.

### Phase 3: Audit Trails and Logging
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Integrate with Logging Agent.
  - Implement audit trail logging.

### Phase 4: Compliance and Security Standards
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Conduct security audits.
  - Ensure compliance with industry standards.

## 7. Claude Code Instructions

### 7.1 Context Files Required
- `auth_config.json`: Configuration for authentication settings.
- `azure_ad_config.json`: Azure AD integration settings.
- `key_vault_config.json`: Azure Key Vault settings.

### 7.2 Implementation Prompts
- `--add-dir auth`: Add authentication module.
- `--add-dir azure_ad`: Integrate Azure AD.
- `--add-dir audit_logging`: Implement audit logging.

### 7.3 Validation Criteria
- Ensure JWT tokens are correctly issued and validated.
- Verify Azure AD integration with test accounts.
- Confirm audit logs are generated for all security events.

## 8. Success Metrics and Testing
- **Authentication Success Rate**: 99% successful logins.
- **Authorization Accuracy**: 100% correct role-based access.
- **Audit Trail Completeness**: 100% of security events logged.
- **Compliance**: Pass all security audits and compliance checks.
