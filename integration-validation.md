## Key Integration Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Router Issues
**Problem**: Next.js static export failing due to SSR router access
**Solution**: Added mounted state checks and conditional rendering

### 2. API Port Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend configured for port 5002, backend for port 5056
**Solution**: Updated backend launch settings and JWT configuration

### 3. Missing Refresh Token Endpoint
**Problem**: Frontend trying to call `/api/auth/refresh-token` but endpoint didn't exist
**Solution**: Added complete refresh token implementation to AuthController

### 4. Authentication Flow
**Problem**: Complex authentication requirements with multi-tenancy
**Solution**: Integrated IJwtService with proper dependency injection

### 5. Error Handling
**Problem**: No global error handling for unhandled exceptions
**Solution**: Added GlobalExceptionMiddleware with consistent error responses

## System Architecture Validated

### Backend (ASP.NET Core 8.0)
- ✅ Clean Architecture implementation
- ✅ CQRS with MediatR
- ✅ Multi-tenant data isolation
- ✅ JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- ✅ Entity Framework Core with migrations
- ✅ Comprehensive middleware pipeline

### Frontend (Next.js 14)
- ✅ TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Static export configuration
- ✅ Context-based state management
- ✅ API integration with axios
- ✅ Multi-layout system (Admin, Client, Public)
- ✅ Token refresh automation

### Integration Layer
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Consistent API response formats
- ✅ Error handling across all layers
- ✅ Security headers and rate limiting
- ✅ Audit logging for compliance

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- Service layer tests exist for JWT and Authorization services

### Integration Tests
- Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- Authentication flow testing
- Security and authorization testing
- UI integration testing
- Error handling validation

## Known Limitations

1. **Database Dependency**: System requires SQL Server for full functionality
2. **Environment Setup**: Some configuration may need adjustment for different environments
3. **External Dependencies**: Cosmos DB and Blob Storage configurations present but may not be needed for MVP

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Environment Configuration**: Update connection strings and JWT keys for production
2. **SSL Certificates**: Configure HTTPS properly for production
3. **Database Setup**: Ensure production database is properly configured
4. **Monitoring**: Add application insights or similar monitoring
5. **Deployment**: Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
