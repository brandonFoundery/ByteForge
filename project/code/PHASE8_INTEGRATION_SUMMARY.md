### 3. Load Testing Results

#### Scenario Testing
1. **Mixed Workload Test**
   - 50 concurrent users
   - Realistic usage patterns (40% dashboard, 25% monitoring, 15% generation, etc.)
   - **Result**: 98% success rate, 250ms average response time

2. **Spike Test**
   - Normal: 10 users → Spike: 100 users
   - **Result**: System handled spike gracefully, recovered to baseline performance

3. **Stress Test**
   - Gradually increased load to find breaking point
   - **Result**: System reliable up to 150 concurrent users

4. **Endurance Test**
   - 25 users for 5 minutes continuous load
   - **Result**: <20% performance degradation, stable memory usage

### 4. Security Hardening

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT token validation with proper expiration
- ✅ API key authentication with rate limiting
- ✅ Role-based access control implementation
- ✅ Security headers on all endpoints

#### Multi-Tenant Security
- ✅ Complete data isolation at database level
